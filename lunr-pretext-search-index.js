  "body": " Mathematical Models    Media outlets regularly publish rankings of cell phone carriers, travel destinations, colleges, TVs, and credit cards, just to mention a few.  Here's an example of one such ranking - the \" Best Places to Retire on Earth ,\" according to investopedia.com . To determine which countries are the best for retirees, they used a scoring system that measured seven categories:   Visa\/benefits  Climate  Cost of living  Development  Healthcare  Housing  Affinity rating   The top 4 countries with the highest cumulative average score across all those categories are Costa Rica, Portugal, Mexico, and Panama.  When creating rankings like the one above, we first need to decide what factors (variables) will contribute to the overall ranking. Then, we need to decide how those factors can be measured (quantified). Finally, we need a formula that combines all of them into one overall score.   Important factors for a decision or situation are called variables . Variables that have values that are numbers called quantitative variables .   In your group, agree on a topic that interests everyone (or most of you!), and try to come up with a strategy to create a ranking system related to that topic. After agreeing on a topic, think about:   What variables to use;  How to measure those variables; and  How to combine all of them into one overall score.      Every year, U.S. News & World Report publishes a list of the best colleges in the United States. Colleges on the list are ranked based on many different factors, such as first-year student retention, graduation rates, and faculty strength.    Using what you know about how U.S. News ranks colleges, discuss what things you might include in your decision in choosing a college. That is, what factors would be important to your decision?    Brainstorm how numeric values could be used to quantify (express with numbers) the variables you identified above. Include the units of measurement.      A mathematical model is a description of a system, or situation, using mathematical concepts, language, and numbers. People often use variables to help create mathematical models. Mathematical models can be represented as equations, tables, graphs, or descriptions in words.    Let's look at a mathematical model for ranking community colleges that combines variables to give us one number for each community college. The Aspen Institute awards the Aspen Prize every other year. The award \"honors those institutions that strive for and achieve exceptional levels of success for all students, while they are in college and after they graduate.\" In addition to the prestige of winning this award, the winning college also receives a $1 million cash prize. To determine the 150 finalists for the award, the Aspen Institute collects information from 1000 community colleges related to the following variables:  Performance - The performance score measures student success in persistence, degrees awarded, completion, and transfer;  Change - The change score measures consistent improvement in these areas over time; and  Minority Achievement and Family Income - The minority achievement score and family income score measure equitable outcomes for students of all racial\/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Each of these scores is created from combining a great deal of information about many factors.    Look at the scores in the table below for four community colleges. Which school do you think is the “best?” Why? (Hint: What data are you focusing on in the table?)

Estimate whether the amount of money they loaded onto their coffee card will last until the end of the month.    Explain why a linear model would describe the amount of money Arlo has left on their card.    What is the vertical intercept for the linear model? The slope? How do you know?

(Note: There are about 22 weekdays in a month.)        Many old comic books contained ads offering money-making schemes to children reading the comics. As an example, suppose a company offered to send 30 greeting cards to a child to sell to relatives, friends, and neighbors. The child was to sell them for dollars each, and had to send dollars back to the company. Here is a graph of a linear model representing the situation. The input (horizontal value) represents the number of cards sold, and the output (vertical value) represents the child's profit in dollars.   Relationship between Latte Purchase and Amount Left on Card    The horizontal axis is ranges from -3 to 42. The vertical axis is ranges from -13 to 16. The graph shows a line with vertical intercept -10 and horizontal intercept 20.   Blank axes.       Find a formula for , the child's profit, in terms of , the number of comics they sell.  Hints: What information do you need to find a formula for a linear model?    What are and in the story?    What is the horizontal intercept? What does it represent in the context of this problem?    How much money will the child earn if they sell all 30 cards?        Data plans for cell phone plans can be purchased in two different ways. One is an unlimited data plan where the customer pays a set monthly fee for unlimited data. The other is a per-gigabyte (GB) pricing service where the customer pays a set monthly fee plus a specified amount for each GB. The GBs are not prorated (that means it doesn't matter if the customer uses 0.001 GB or 1 GB, they must still pay for the entire 1 GB). The cost of the phone itself and other fees are the same amount under each plan.  Ximena is shopping for a data plan and needs to decide which option costs less.  Per-GB Pricing: There is a monthly fee of $20 plus $10 per GB.  Unlimited Data: The unlimited plan costs $60 per month.      Which plan do you think is less expensive and why?

According to Berkeley Earth, \"The analysis shows that the rise [or growth] in average world land temperature[is]... about 1.3 degrees Celsius.\"\" BEST states that \"global warming is real,\"\" and attributes the temperature trend to a combination of volcanoes and CO 2 .  There are others who are skeptical of the theory of \"global warming\" and hold a contrary view of weather data. These people believe that there are other explanations and reasons for the climate changes being experienced. In the next two activities, we are going to examine the Berkeley Earth project data and linear models for Global Surface Temperature Change to study the issue of global warming.  On the website , the data from the Berkeley Earth project has been used as the source for two different analyses of the same information. The first one is labeled \"How Realists View Global Warming\" and the other is \"How Contrarians View Global Warming.\" The two infographics are reproduced here. You will see that each includes a line or line segments along with the actual data. Use these infographics to answer the following questions.      Below is an infographic showing the data gathered by BEST showing the monthly \"Global Temperature Anomaly\" (that is, the change in average Global Temperature, in degrees Celsius) for the years 1970-2022. Shown on the graph is a trendline, also known as a line of best fit, that is a linear model representing the trend of the data. It is stated on the project's website that the baseline period is the 1850-1900 mean. This means that the data from 1970-2022 is compared with the data from 1850-1900.

  "body": " Average Rates of Change    These activities will help you review some graphing skills that you will need in many future lessons. You will also review finding average speed, which you will build on in this lesson.     There are many types of graphs in math! In previous courses, you may have seen:  Bar charts  Pie charts  Scatterplots  Graphs of functions in the plane  and more. When we talk about graphs in this class, we will always mean graphs of points or curves in the plane (unless we specifically say otherwise). We will use these graphs in almost every lesson, so it is essential that you know how to read and create them.    The graph below shows several points in the plane (aka coordinate plane). The horizontal axis goes from left to right and is the boldest left-to-right line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The vertical axis goes up and down and is the boldst up-and-down line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The axes are two number lines that create a grid on the coordinate plane. (Note: Axis is singular and axes is plural.)   Example of points in the coordinate plane.    Point A is at (2,3). Point B is at (-3,1). Point C is at (-1,-1). Point D is at (-1,3). Point E is at (0,1). Point F is at (4,0). Point G is at (0,-3). Point H is at (2,1). Point I is at (-1,1). Point J is at (-4,0).   10 points in the coordinate plane     The point at which the two axes intersect is called the origin . This point represents 0 for both axes, and is given the coordinates (aka ordered pair ) . Each point in the plane has coordinates (horizontal value, vertical value). For example, the point has the coordinates , the point has the coordinates , and the point has coordinates .  Write the coordinates of the rest of the points in this graph.        We will often be interested in graphs of lines and curves, rather than graphs of invidual points. Here is a graph that we will see again soon.   Team A    Parabola facing down. Increases from to about , then decreases to . The horizontal axis is labeled seconds and the vertical axis is labeled meters.   Parabola facing down. Increases from (0,0) to about (8,27), then decreases to (10,25).     This graph shows Team A's location from the starting line at every time during a race. From the axis labels, we can tell that the vertical axis tells us their location in meters and the horizontal axis tells us the time in seconds since the race began. Common types of questions to ask about this sort of graph include:   Where was Team A 10 sec into the race?   Solution: Since seconds are on the horizontal axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose horizontal coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the horizontal axis and look directly above and below until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the vertical coordinate of that point. In this case, our answer is 25 m.    How long did it take Team A to go 10 m?   Solution: Since distance in meters is on the vertical axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose vertical coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the vertical axis and look directly to the right and left until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the horizontal coordinate of that point. In this case, we see that our point is between 1 and 2 on the horizontal axis.

When we talk about graphs in this class, we will always mean graphs of points or curves in the plane (unless we specifically say otherwise). We will use these graphs in almost every lesson, so it is essential that you know how to read and create them.    The graph below shows several points in the plane (aka coordinate plane). The horizontal axis goes from left to right and is the boldest left-to-right line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The vertical axis goes up and down and is the boldst up-and-down line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The axes are two number lines that create a grid on the coordinate plane. (Note: Axis is singular and axes is plural.)   Example of points in the coordinate plane.    Point A is at (2,3). Point B is at (-3,1). Point C is at (-1,-1). Point D is at (-1,3). Point E is at (0,1). Point F is at (4,0). Point G is at (0,-3). Point H is at (2,1). Point I is at (-1,1). Point J is at (-4,0).   10 points in the coordinate plane     The point at which the two axes intersect is called the origin . This point represents 0 for both axes, and is given the coordinates (aka ordered pair ) . Each point in the plane has coordinates (horizontal value, vertical value). For example, the point has the coordinates , the point has the coordinates , and the point has coordinates .  Write the coordinates of the rest of the points in this graph.   "

Increases from (0,0) to about (8,27), then decreases to (10,25).     This graph shows Team A's location from the starting line at every time during a race. From the axis labels, we can tell that the vertical axis tells us their location in meters and the horizontal axis tells us the time in seconds since the race began. Common types of questions to ask about this sort of graph include:   Where was Team A 10 sec into the race?   Solution: Since seconds are on the horizontal axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose horizontal coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the horizontal axis and look directly above and below until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the vertical coordinate of that point. In this case, our answer is 25 m.    How long did it take Team A to go 10 m?   Solution: Since distance in meters is on the vertical axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose vertical coordinate is 10.

These activities will introduce the idea of linear trends, which we'll spend more time in class. They'll also provide practice with building a linear model by identifying its slope and vertical intercept.     Several years ago, Onondaga Community College, in upstate New York, introduced a meal plan that included \"Flex Dollars\" that were stored on students' ID cards. Each student was given $150 \"Flex Dollars\" as part of their meal plan package that could be used like cash at several campus dining locations.

What is the vertical intercept tell you in context? the horizontal intercept?    Let be the amount of money left on the card, weeks after the beginning of the semester. Write a linear equation to model the data. Use Week 0 and Week 14 to calculate the slope.    If Loralee continues to spend her flex dollars at the same rate, use your equation to determine how much money will be on the card at the end of spring semester, which also lasts 14 weeks.        Smartphones, like many other manufactured goods, depreciate on a daily basis. Depreciation means how much an item (e.g. a smartphone) loses in value compared to the price that was originally paid for it from the manufacturer. There tends to be two main periods in a smartphone's life when it sees the biggest drops in value: 1. the period of time after the phone is initially purchased, and 2. when the manufacturer launches a new model.  In September 2019, the iPhone 11 256GB was released with a price of $849. Twelve months after the launch, it was found that the value of iPhone 11s depreciated about 37% (which is actually better than most smartphone depreciation!).   Suppose Coraline bought a new iPhone 11 256GB in September 2019 for $849. The phone would soon start depreciating in value.

What is the vertical intercept of the graph? What does it mean in relation to the situation?    Write an equation that gives a linear model for the value of the cell phone from Sept 2019 through February 2020. Use for the value in dollars, for the number of the month, and your slope estimate.    Suppose Coraline wants to sell her phone before it is worth less than $300.

  "body": "  Let's continue analyzing the depreciation of Coraline's phone.    Give an estimate for the slope of the model, and explain what it means in this situation.    What is the vertical intercept of the graph? What does it mean in relation to the situation?    Write an equation that gives a linear model for the value of the cell phone from Sept 2019 through February 2020. Use for the value in dollars, for the number of the month, and your slope estimate.    Suppose Coraline wants to sell her phone before it is worth less than $300. Using your model, when is the last month she could sell it and get at least $300?    What is the horizontal intercept of your model? What is the meaning of this in the context of this problem? Is this reasonable?   "
