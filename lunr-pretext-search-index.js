  "body": " Mathematical Models Activities    Media outlets regularly publish rankings of cell phone carriers, travel destinations, colleges, TVs, and credit cards, just to mention a few.  Here's an example of one such ranking - the Best Places to Retire on Earth , according to investopedia.com . To determine which countries are the best for retirees, they used a scoring system that measured seven categories:   Visa\/benefits  Climate  Cost of living  Development  Healthcare  Housing  Affinity rating   The top 4 countries with the highest cumulative average score across all those categories are Costa Rica, Portugal, Mexico, and Panama.  When creating rankings like the one above, we first need to decide what factors (variables) will contribute to the overall ranking. Then, we need to decide how those factors can be measured (quantified). Finally, we need a formula that combines all of them into one overall score.   Important factors for a decision or situation are called variables . Variables that have values that are numbers called quantitative variables .   In your group, agree on a topic that interests everyone (or most of you!), and try to come up with a strategy to create a ranking system related to that topic. After agreeing on a topic, think about:   What variables to use;  How to measure those variables; and  How to combine all of them into one overall score.      Every year, U.S. News & World Report publishes a list of the best colleges in the United States. Colleges on the list are ranked based on many different factors, such as first-year student retention, graduation rates, and faculty strength.    Using what you know about how U.S. News ranks colleges, discuss what things you might include in your decision in choosing a college. That is, what factors would be important to your decision?    Brainstorm how numeric values could be used to quantify (express with numbers) the variables you identified above. Include the units of measurement.      A mathematical model is a description of a system, or situation, using mathematical concepts, language, and numbers. People often use variables to help create mathematical models. Mathematical models can be represented as equations, tables, graphs, or descriptions in words.    Let's look at a mathematical model for ranking community colleges that combines variables to give us one number for each community college. The Aspen Institute awards the Aspen Prize every other year. The award honors those institutions that strive for and achieve exceptional levels of success for all students, while they are in college and after they graduate. In addition to the prestige of winning this award, the winning college also receives a $1 million cash prize. To determine the 150 finalists for the award, the Aspen Institute collects information from 1000 community colleges related to the following variables:  Performance - The performance score measures student success in persistence, degrees awarded, completion, and transfer;  Change - The change score measures consistent improvement in these areas over time; and  Minority Achievement and Family Income - The minority achievement score and family income score measure equitable outcomes for students of all racial\/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Each of these scores is created from combining a great deal of information about many factors.    Look at the scores in the table below for four community colleges. Which school do you think is the best? Why? (Hint: What data are you focusing on in the table?)     College  State  Performance  Change  Minority Achievement  Family Income     Bergen Community College  NJ  299  800  178  70     Miami Dade College  FL  323  400  288  191     Northwest Iowa Community College  IA  503  200  437  99     Pearl River Community College  MS  444  600  275  118        The Aspen institute used the following mathematical model equation to calculate a score for each school: where:  Overall ranking score (higher scores are best)  Performance score  Change score  Minority score  Family income score  Use this equation to calculate the overall score for each of the schools and enter it into the table above. According to the overall score you calculated, which school is best?        Body Mass Index, or BMI, is often used to classify people as obese or underweight. The formula for BMI is    What variables are used to calculate BMI?  A 2012 study found that the proportion of Americans that are severely obese was increasing. How do you think the researchers in this study obtained information about these variables? Imagine yourselves as the researchers. You will want a large, varied sample, and you have limited funds. What would be a good way to get people's height and weight from diverse U.S. locations?   If you want to determine whether someone is obese, are there any other variables that might be important to consider?    The table below lists known heights and weights of several current and former athletes. Calculate the BMI for each of the athletes. Use the fact that one inch is 0.0254 meters and one pound is about 0.454 kilograms.    Athlete  Height (ft & in)  Height (m)  Weight (lbs)  Weight (kg)  BMI ( )    Rory McIlroy (Golf)  5 ft 10 in   160      Julianna Penn (UFC)  5 ft 7 in   135      Cam Gallagher (Baseball)  6 ft 3 in   230      Breanna Stewart (WNBA)  6 ft 4 in   170      Shaquille O'Neal (NBA)  7 ft 1 in   325      Maria Sharapova (Tennis)  6 ft 2 in   130          The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that  BMI below 18.5 is underweight  BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is normal  BMI between 25 and 29.9 is overweight  BMI of 30 and above is obsese  What are the athletes' classifications based on their BMIs? What does this suggest about limitations of the BMI model?    Consider the following two scenarios. In each scenario, which person has the lower BMI?   Marisol and Adelyn have the same weight, but Marisol is taller.  Aries and Niko have the same height, but Aries weighs more.         Most of the mathematical models that we'll explore in this class are functions . A function is a special type of mathematical model that matches each value of its input quantity to exactly one value of its output quantity. Mathematicians use a special notation for functions, , which is read of . It has three parts:    is the name of the function or model   is the input  all together is the output . If we have , then is also the output.    Identify the input, output, and function name in each of the math sentences below.                          Function notation is a compact way to keep track of and connect several pieces of information. Let's practice interpreting it in an example.  The table below shows the percent of US adults (18+) who said they used Instagram in each year Data from Pew Research Center surveys on social media use. .   Percent of US Adults That Use Instagram    Year,  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2018  2019  2021  2023    Percent,  13  17  26  28  32  35  37  40  47     Using function notation, we can write the sentence 13% of US adults used Instagram in 2012 as .    Use function notation to write the sentence 47% of US adults used Instagram in 2023 .    Interpret by writing a sentence in words.    We can use the table to evaluate expressions in function notation. For example, if we're asked Evaluate , the table tells us the answer is .  Evaluate .    We can also use the table to solve equations in function notation. For example, if we're asked Solve the equation , the answer is , since that's the year in which of US adults used Instagram, according to the table.  Solve the equation .      We can also use function notation with graphs. In the graph below, let be the year, and be the life expetancy at birth in year .

You will also review finding average speed, which you will build on in this lesson.     There are many types of graphs in math! In previous courses, you may have seen:  Bar charts  Pie charts  Scatterplots  Graphs of functions in the plane  and more. When we talk about graphs in this class, we will always mean graphs of points or curves in the plane (unless we specifically say otherwise). We will use these graphs in almost every lesson, so it is essential that you know how to read and create them.    The graph below shows several points in the plane (aka coordinate plane). The horizontal axis goes from left to right and is the boldest left-to-right line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The vertical axis goes up and down and is the boldst up-and-down line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The axes are two number lines that create a grid on the coordinate plane. (Note: Axis is singular and axes is plural.)   Example of points in the coordinate plane.    Point A is at (2,3). Point B is at (-3,1). Point C is at (-1,-1). Point D is at (-1,3). Point E is at (0,1). Point F is at (4,0). Point G is at (0,-3). Point H is at (2,1). Point I is at (-1,1). Point J is at (-4,0).   10 points in the coordinate plane     The point at which the two axes intersect is called the origin . This point represents 0 for both axes, and is given the coordinates (aka ordered pair ) . Each point in the plane has coordinates (horizontal value, vertical value). For example, the point has the coordinates , the point has the coordinates , and the point has coordinates .  Write the coordinates of the rest of the points in this graph.        We will often be interested in graphs of lines and curves, rather than graphs of invidual points. Here is a graph that we will see again soon.   Team A    Parabola facing down. Increases from to about , then decreases to . The horizontal axis is labeled seconds and the vertical axis is labeled meters.   Parabola facing down. Increases from (0,0) to about (8,27), then decreases to (10,25).     This graph shows Team A's location from the starting line at every time during a race. From the axis labels, we can tell that the vertical axis tells us their location in meters and the horizontal axis tells us the time in seconds since the race began. Common types of questions to ask about this sort of graph include:   Where was Team A 10 sec into the race?   Solution: Since seconds are on the horizontal axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose horizontal coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the horizontal axis and look directly above and below until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the vertical coordinate of that point. In this case, our answer is 25 m.    How long did it take Team A to go 10 m?   Solution: Since distance in meters is on the vertical axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose vertical coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the vertical axis and look directly to the right and left until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the horizontal coordinate of that point. In this case, we see that our point is between 1 and 2 on the horizontal axis. It's a little closer to 2 than to 1, we estimate that our answer is 1.6 sec. When we estimate, there's a range of acceptable answers. In this case, any number between 1.5 and 1.9 is a reasonable estimate.       Where was Team A after 5 seconds?    How long did it take Team A to go 20 m?        You will also need to know how to find average speed. Average speed is . For example, if I drove 100 miles in 2 hours, then my average speed was . Another example is that if after 2 hours, I was 100 mi from home and after 5 hours, I was 210 miles from home, then my average speed between hour 2 and hour 5 was     What was Team A's average speed between 5 and 10 seconds into the race?    What was Team A's average speed between 1.6 and 3.9 seconds into the race?     You'll need to be able to do the following things for this lesson. Rate how confident you are on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 = not confident and 5 = very confident).

It's a little closer to 2 than to 1, we estimate that our answer is 1.6 sec. When we estimate, there's a range of acceptable answers. In this case, any number between 1.5 and 1.9 is a reasonable estimate.       Where was Team A after 5 seconds?    How long did it take Team A to go 20 m?   "

Data Set 1    Input  Output    -4  -4    -2  2    0  8    2  14    4  20      Data Set 2    Input  Output    10  2    20  10    40  26    80  58    160  122      Data Set 3    Input  Output    -5  3    0  4.5    5  7.5    10  12    15  18         The vertical intercept of a mathematical model is the value where the graph crosses the vertical axis. It is also called the initial value because it is the output when the input is 0. What is the vertical intercept of your graph in part (e)?    Suppose that Theo used kWh of energy in a summer month. Find a formula for , Theo's bill.  Reminder: is read of and is NOT multiplication; is the name of the function, is the input, and all together is the output. In this context, is the kWh of energy that Theo used, and is the amount of money he owes.    How do the slope and vertical intercept of the linear model appear in your formula in part (b)?    Write a sentence describing how to build a formula to find the output of a linear model from its slope, vertical intercept, and an input value.    Suppose a family makes a quarterly (3-month) budget to plan for upcoming expenses. This family estimates they will use an average of 1000 kWh per month in July, August and September. How much money must the family set aside in the budget so that they will be able to pay for the electricity they will use during the three-month period? Round to the nearest dollar, since budgets are only estimates.        A local coffee shop offers a coffee card that you can preload with any amount of money and use like a debit card each day to purchase coffee. At the beginning of the month (when they get their paycheck), Arlo loads it with $50. Their favorite small soy latte costs $2.63.    Arlo purchases a latte every weekday. Estimate whether the amount of money they loaded onto their coffee card will last until the end of the month.    Explain why a linear model would describe the amount of money Arlo has left on their card.    What is the vertical intercept for the linear model? The slope? How do you know?    Let be the amount Arlo has left on their coffee card and be the number of latte's they've purchased. Find a formula for the linear model relating and .    Sketch a graph of your linear model.   Relationship between Latte Purchase and Amount Left on Card    Blank axes. The horizontal axis is labeled lattes and ranges from 0 to 25. The vertical axis is labeled $ and ranges from 0 to 50.   Blank axes.       A horizontal intercept of a mathematical model is the value where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. It tells us the input value that has an output value of 0. What is the horizontal intercept of this model?    Will Arlo's card last until the end of the month? If so, how much is left? If not, how many days will it last? (Note: There are about 22 weekdays in a month.)        Many old comic books contained ads offering money-making schemes to children reading the comics. As an example, suppose a company offered to send 30 greeting cards to a child to sell to relatives, friends, and neighbors. The child was to sell them for dollars each, and had to send dollars back to the company. Here is a graph of a linear model representing the situation. The input (horizontal value) represents the number of cards sold, and the output (vertical value) represents the child's profit in dollars.   Relationship between Latte Purchase and Amount Left on Card    The horizontal axis is ranges from -3 to 42. The vertical axis is ranges from -13 to 16. The graph shows a line with vertical intercept -10 and horizontal intercept 20.   Blank axes.       Find a formula for , the child's profit, in terms of , the number of comics they sell.  Hint: What information do you need to find a formula for a linear model?    What are and in the story?    What is the horizontal intercept? What does it represent in the context of this problem?    How much money will the child earn if they sell all 30 cards?        Data plans for cell phone plans can be purchased in two different ways. One is an unlimited data plan where the customer pays a set monthly fee for unlimited data. The other is a per-gigabyte (GB) pricing service where the customer pays a set monthly fee plus a specified amount for each GB. The GBs are not prorated (that means it doesn't matter if the customer uses 0.001 GB or 1 GB, they must still pay for the entire 1 GB). The cost of the phone itself and other fees are the same amount under each plan.  Ximena is shopping for a data plan and needs to decide which option costs less.  Per-GB Pricing: There is a monthly fee of $20 plus $10 per GB.  Unlimited Data: The unlimited plan costs $60 per month.      Which plan do you think is less expensive and why?    Let be the monthly cost for the per-GB pricing plan and be the number of gigabytes used. Create the linear model for in terms of .    Let be the monthly cost for the unlimited pricing plan and be the number of gigabytes used. Create the linear model for in terms of .    Sketch both of your linear models on the same graph.

These activities will introduce the idea of linear trends, which we'll spend more time in class. They'll also provide practice with building a linear model by identifying its slope and vertical intercept.     Several years ago, Onondaga Community College, in upstate New York, introduced a meal plan that included Flex Dollars that were stored on students' ID cards. Each student was given $150 Flex Dollars as part of their meal plan package that could be used like cash at several campus dining locations.

Smartphones, like many other manufactured goods, depreciate on a daily basis. Depreciation means how much an item (e.g. a smartphone) loses in value compared to the price that was originally paid for it from the manufacturer. There tends to be two main periods in a smartphone's life when it sees the biggest drops in value: 1. the period of time after the phone is initially purchased, and 2. when the manufacturer launches a new model.  In September 2019, the iPhone 11 256GB was released with a price of $849. Twelve months after the launch, it was found that the value of iPhone 11s depreciated about 37% (which is actually better than most smartphone depreciation!).   Suppose Coraline bought a new iPhone 11 256GB in September 2019 for $849. The phone would soon start depreciating in value. The following table shows the approximate value of her iPhone 11, by month from September 2019.

  "body": " Linear Trends Activities     In 2022, Nelson created the following graph to represent his annual pay over the years.   Nelson's Annual Pay    Pay in 2012 was $24,000. In 2013 it was about $25,000. In 2014 it was about $27,000. In 2015 it was about $27,500. In 2016 it was about $28,500. In 2017 it was about $28,500. In 2018 it was about $29,000. In 2019 it as about $30,000. In 2020 it was about $31,000. In 2021 it was about $31,500. In 2022 it was $32,000.   Graph showing annual pay in each year between 2012 and 2022.       Find a linear equation that approximately models the above situation. Use to represent Nelson's pay in dollars and to represent the number of years since 2012.    If the trend continues, in what year would he expect to earn $36,000 a year?    Nelson is using extrapoloation to predict his future salary, so his prediction is unlikely to be perfect and could even be quite a bit off. Extrapolation is the process of using a mathematical model to make predictions that are outside the range of the available data, based on the assumption that existing trends will continue. The problem with extrapolation is that the trend could change in the future, for any number of reasons, which would make the prediction unreliable. Give at least one example of way that the trend in Nelson's salary might change and result his prediction being very wrong.        The following table shows the average weight for infant boys:    Average Weight of Boys, Ages 10 - 20 months    Age (months)  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20    Weight (kg)  9.2  9.4  9.7  9.9  10.1  10.3  10.5  10.7  10.9  11.1  11.4       Explain why a linear model could be created and used to fairly accurately calculate the average weight of an infant boy, given his age in months.    Create a linear model for the weight of infant boys.    Use your model to predict the weight of a 14.5-month-old boy. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.    Use your model to predict the weight of a 2-year-old boy. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.    Use your model to predict the weight of a 25-year-old man. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.    Every year, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project releases an analysis of land-surface temperature records (some going back as far as 250 years). According to Berkeley Earth, The analysis shows that the rise [or growth] in average world land temperature[is]... about 1.3 degrees Celsius. BEST states that global warming is real, and attributes the temperature trend to a combination of volcanoes and CO 2 .  There are others who are skeptical of the theory of global warming and hold a contrary view of weather data. These people believe that there are other explanations and reasons for the climate changes being experienced. In the next two activities, we are going to examine the Berkeley Earth project data and linear models for Global Surface Temperature Change to study the issue of global warming.  On the website , the data from the Berkeley Earth project has been used as the source for two different analyses of the same information. The first one is labeled How Realists View Global Warming > and the other is How Contrarians View Global Warming. The two infographics are reproduced here. You will see that each includes a line or line segments along with the actual data. Use these infographics to answer the following questions.      Below is an infographic showing the data gathered by BEST showing the monthly Global Temperature Anomaly (that is, the change in average Global Temperature, in degrees Celsius) for the years 1970-2022. It is stated on the project's website that the baseline period is the 1850-1900 mean. This means that the data from 1970-2022 is compared with the data from 1850-1900.   Difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a trendline. Image from Quantway College Module M.3 by Carnegie Math Pathways   Graph showing the difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a trendline.   The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. Exact points on the trend line are hard to estimate, but it appears that (1970, 0.21) and (2022, 1.28) are both approximately on the line.     Shown on the graph is a trendline, also known as a line of best fit, that is a linear model representing the trend of the data.    What are the units on the horizontal axis? What is the variable?    What are the units on the vertical axis? What is the variable?    What does one point on the graph represent?    Now look at the trendline that is drawn on the graph. What does this line represent?    Do you think the trendline is reasonable? Does it represent the trends in the data?    Estimate the value where the trendline crosses the vertical axis (we will treat this as the value in 1970). Describe the meaning of the point where the trendline crosses the vertical axis.    Estimate the slope of this line in degrees Celsius per year (although the original data is monthly, the slope will be per year). Write an interpretation of the slope in this context. Be sure to use units with your values, and use complete sentences. Finding exact points on this line is difficult. Just do your best to estimate two points and use them to find the slope.    Using your own estimates, estimate the equation of the line.    What is the model saying about the general pattern of the global temperature. Is it rising or falling?    Using your linear equation from above, predict the temperature change at the end of 2030. Also predict the temperature change at the end of 2050. Do you think this is a reliable prediction for 2050? Why or why not? Explain using complete sentences.        The infographic below contains the same data points for the Global Temperature Change (the change in average Global Temperature in the years from 1970-2022) that were included in the infographic showing How Realists View Global Warming. This infographic is meant to depict a common view stated by contrarians that global warming is not real since there have been several periods over the last 50 years when global temperatures have declined on average.   Difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a piecewise model. Image from Quantway College Module M.3 by Carnegie Math Pathways   Graph showing the difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a piecewise model.   The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. There are seven short-term trendlines shown, each of which is either decreasing or roughly horizontal. The trend line from 2010 to 2015 starts at about (2010, 1.1) and ends at about (2015, 0.9).     Also shown is a piecewise model, which is a model defined by multiple pieces, each of which has its own trendline that represents the trend of the data within a certain interval. This infographic shows a linear piecewise model that consists of 7 line segments - each of which can be considered a trendline for that restricted time period.    Look at the line segments that are drawn on the graph. What do these lines represent as a whole?    Now look at just the segment of the piecewise best fit model from 2010 to 2015 (the line segment second farthest to the right). Estimate where the line segment would cross the vertical axis (in year 1970). (Hint: It might be useful to use a straight-edged item to extend the line to the vertical axis. You can see the line is very slightly slanted.)    What is the slope value of the 2010 to 2015 line segment? Give an interpretation of the slope value.    Estimate the equation of the 2010 to 2015 line segment.    Could we use the equation of the 2010 to 2015 line segment to predict the mean Global Surface Temperature Change in 2035? Why or why not?    Explain what the Contrarian Model is saying about the general pattern of global temperature. Is it rising or falling? Think about this on your own for a minute before sharing your ideas in your group.    If you look at the overall trend of the data in the infographic, it is increasing. However, each line segment in the piecewise model is decreasing (ever so slightly). What does this mean? Explain what the model is saying about the general pattern of global temperature change.    Come up with an example of a similar piecewise linear model. Note that models can be represented in different ways - tables, graphs, written descriptions, or equations. We will explore piecewise models in the next lesson.     "

Now, let's consider the cost of electricity in and around Denver in the winter. Use the information given in the table above to build a linear model for the bill amount, , of a customer that uses kWh in the winter.    The company that provides electricity to people in and around New Orleans, Louisiana is called Entergy. The table below estimates the winter monthly rates charged by Entergy . Let be the monthly bill amount and be the number of kWh used.

Build a linear model for the bill , of a customer that used 800 kWh or less.   Build a linear model for the bill , of a customer that used more than 800 kWh.        The situation in is called piecewise defined or a piecewise linear model. It is piecewise because the cost changes based on the amount of electricity used. Cost per kWh is not constant, so the graph of this situation is not a line. But it is piecewise linear, because cost per kWh is constant on each piece.  We found that when the number of kilowatt hours used, is 800 or less, the bill is . When the number of kilowatt hours used is more than 800, , or . Mathematicians like to put both of these equations together like this: The { symbol is there to tell you that this is a piecewise formula. The at the end of the first line tells you to use that part of the formula when is 800 or less. The at the end of the second line tells you to use that part of the formula when is bigger than 800.    Use the piecewise formula to find the bill for customers who used 600 kWh, 900 kWh, and 1200 kWh. You should get the same answers as you did in     Graph this piecewise linear model.

Fill in the blank with little or no calculation: If Julio only drives _________ miles during the day, Trucks-4-Less will end up being the better deal. Explain your reasoning.    Fill in the blank with little or no calculation: If Julio drives _________ miles during the day, Rent-A-Truk will end up being the better deal. Explain your reasoning.    Without doing any calculations, do you know if there will ever be a time when the two rental plans would cost the same?    How much total mileage used will make the cost of both rental plans about the same? Use any method you wish to make this approximation.    Set up an algebraic model that can be used to represent the cost for using Rent-A-Truk, given that one plans on driving miles.    If a person plans on driving miles, what would the algebraic model be to represent the cost for using Trucks-4-Less, ?    Julio might want to know at what mileage the cost of the Rent-A-Truk plan equals the cost of the Trucks-4-Less plan. Use your algebraic models to write one equation, using only the variable , that represents this situation.  Hint: You can think about this situation as .  Hint: Julio estimated that this situation occurs at a mileage higher than 40.    Solve your equation for and check whether the solution agrees with your answer to estimate.     "

Cost per kWh is not constant, so the graph of this situation is not a line. But it is piecewise linear, because cost per kWh is constant on each piece.  We found that when the number of kilowatt hours used, is 800 or less, the bill is . When the number of kilowatt hours used is more than 800, , or . Mathematicians like to put both of these equations together like this: The { symbol is there to tell you that this is a piecewise formula.
