Here's an example of one such ranking - the Best Places to Retire on Earth , according to investopedia.com . To determine which countries are the best for retirees, they used a scoring system that measured seven categories:   Visa\/benefits  Climate  Cost of living  Development  Healthcare  Housing  Affinity rating   The top 4 countries with the highest cumulative average score across all those categories are Costa Rica, Portugal, Mexico, and Panama.  When creating rankings like the one above, we first need to decide what factors (variables) will contribute to the overall ranking. Then, we need to decide how those factors can be measured (quantified). Finally, we need a formula that combines all of them into one overall score.   Important factors for a decision or situation are called variables . Variables that have values that are numbers called quantitative variables .   In your group, agree on a topic that interests everyone (or most of you!), and try to come up with a strategy to create a ranking system related to that topic. After agreeing on a topic, think about:   What variables to use;  How to measure those variables; and  How to combine all of them into one overall score.      Every year, U.S. News & World Report publishes a list of the best colleges in the United States. Colleges on the list are ranked based on many different factors, such as first-year student retention, graduation rates, and faculty strength.    Using what you know about how U.S. News ranks colleges, discuss what things you might include in your decision in choosing a college. That is, what factors would be important to your decision?    Brainstorm how numeric values could be used to quantify (express with numbers) the variables you identified above. Include the units of measurement.      A mathematical model is a description of a system, or situation, using mathematical concepts, language, and numbers. People often use variables to help create mathematical models. Mathematical models can be represented as equations, tables, graphs, or descriptions in words.    Let's look at a mathematical model for ranking community colleges that combines variables to give us one number for each community college. The Aspen Institute awards the Aspen Prize every other year. The award honors those institutions that strive for and achieve exceptional levels of success for all students, while they are in college and after they graduate. In addition to the prestige of winning this award, the winning college also receives a $1 million cash prize. To determine the 150 finalists for the award, the Aspen Institute collects information from 1000 community colleges related to the following variables:  Performance - The performance score measures student success in persistence, degrees awarded, completion, and transfer;  Change - The change score measures consistent improvement in these areas over time; and  Minority Achievement and Family Income - The minority achievement score and family income score measure equitable outcomes for students of all racial\/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Each of these scores is created from combining a great deal of information about many factors.    Look at the scores in the table below for four community colleges. Which school do you think is the best? Why? (Hint: What data are you focusing on in the table?)     College  State  Performance  Change  Minority Achievement  Family Income     Bergen Community College  NJ  299  800  178  70     Miami Dade College  FL  323  400  288  191     Northwest Iowa Community College  IA  503  200  437  99     Pearl River Community College  MS  444  600  275  118        The Aspen institute used the following mathematical model equation to calculate a score for each school: where:  Overall ranking score (higher scores are best)  Performance score  Change score  Minority score  Family income score  Use this equation to calculate the overall score for each of the schools and enter it into the table above. According to the overall score you calculated, which school is best?        Body Mass Index, or BMI, is often used to classify people as obese or underweight. The formula for BMI is    What variables are used to calculate BMI?  A 2012 study found that the proportion of Americans that are severely obese was increasing. How do you think the researchers in this study obtained information about these variables? Imagine yourselves as the researchers. You will want a large, varied sample, and you have limited funds. What would be a good way to get people's height and weight from diverse U.S. locations?   If you want to determine whether someone is obese, are there any other variables that might be important to consider?    The table below lists known heights and weights of several current and former athletes. Calculate the BMI for each of the athletes. Use the fact that one inch is 0.0254 meters and one pound is about 0.454 kilograms.    Athlete  Height (ft & in)  Height (m)  Weight (lbs)  Weight (kg)  BMI ( )    Rory McIlroy (Golf)  5 ft 10 in   160      Julianna Penn (UFC)  5 ft 7 in   135      Cam Gallagher (Baseball)  6 ft 3 in   230      Breanna Stewart (WNBA)  6 ft 4 in   170      Shaquille O'Neal (NBA)  7 ft 1 in   325      Maria Sharapova (Tennis)  6 ft 2 in   130          The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that  BMI below 18.5 is underweight  BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is normal  BMI between 25 and 29.9 is overweight  BMI of 30 and above is obsese  What are the athletes' classifications based on their BMIs? What does this suggest about limitations of the BMI model?    Consider the following two scenarios. In each scenario, which person has the lower BMI?   Marisol and Adelyn have the same weight, but Marisol is taller.  Aries and Niko have the same height, but Aries weighs more.         Most of the mathematical models that we'll explore in this class are functions . A function is a special type of mathematical model that matches each value of its input quantity to exactly one value of its output quantity. Mathematicians use a special notation for functions, , which is read of . It has three parts:    is the name of the function or model   is the input  all together is the output . If we have , then is also the output.    Identify the input, output, and function name in each of the math sentences below.                          Function notation is a compact way to keep track of and connect several pieces of information. Let's practice interpreting it in an example.  The table below shows the percent of US adults (18+) who said they used Instagram in each year Data from Pew Research Center surveys on social media use. .   Percent of US Adults That Use Instagram    Year,  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2018  2019  2021  2023    Percent,  13  17  26  28  32  35  37  40  47     Using function notation, we can write the sentence 13% of US adults used Instagram in 2012 as .    Use function notation to write the sentence 47% of US adults used Instagram in 2023 .    Interpret by writing a sentence in words.    We can use the table to evaluate expressions in function notation. For example, if we're asked Evaluate , the table tells us the answer is .  Evaluate .    We can also use the table to solve equations in function notation. For example, if we're asked Solve the equation , the answer is , since that's the year in which of US adults used Instagram, according to the table.  Solve the equation .      We can also use function notation with graphs. In the graph below, let be the year, and be the life expetancy at birth in year .

You will also review finding average speed, which you will build on in this lesson.     There are many types of graphs in math! In previous courses, you may have seen:  Bar charts  Pie charts  Scatterplots  Graphs of functions in the plane  and more. When we talk about graphs in this class, we will always mean graphs of points or curves in the plane (unless we specifically say otherwise). We will use these graphs in almost every lesson, so it is essential that you know how to read and create them.    The graph below shows several points in the plane (aka coordinate plane). The horizontal axis goes from left to right and is the boldest left-to-right line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The vertical axis goes up and down and is the boldst up-and-down line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The axes are two number lines that create a grid on the coordinate plane. (Note: Axis is singular and axes is plural.)   Example of points in the coordinate plane.    Point A is at (2,3). Point B is at (-3,1). Point C is at (-1,-1). Point D is at (-1,3). Point E is at (0,1). Point F is at (4,0). Point G is at (0,-3). Point H is at (2,1). Point I is at (-1,1). Point J is at (-4,0).   10 points in the coordinate plane     The point at which the two axes intersect is called the origin . This point represents 0 for both axes, and is given the coordinates (aka ordered pair ) . Each point in the plane has coordinates (horizontal value, vertical value). For example, the point has the coordinates , the point has the coordinates , and the point has coordinates .  Write the coordinates of the rest of the points in this graph.        We will often be interested in graphs of lines and curves, rather than graphs of invidual points. Here is a graph that we will see again soon.   Team A    Parabola facing down. Increases from to about , then decreases to . The horizontal axis is labeled seconds and the vertical axis is labeled meters.   Parabola facing down. Increases from (0,0) to about (8,27), then decreases to (10,25).     This graph shows Team A's location from the starting line at every time during a race. From the axis labels, we can tell that the vertical axis tells us their location in meters and the horizontal axis tells us the time in seconds since the race began. Common types of questions to ask about this sort of graph include:   Where was Team A 10 sec into the race?   Solution: Since seconds are on the horizontal axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose horizontal coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the horizontal axis and look directly above and below until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the vertical coordinate of that point. In this case, our answer is 25 m.    How long did it take Team A to go 10 m?   Solution: Since distance in meters is on the vertical axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose vertical coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the vertical axis and look directly to the right and left until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the horizontal coordinate of that point. In this case, we see that our point is between 1 and 2 on the horizontal axis. It's a little closer to 2 than to 1, we estimate that our answer is 1.6 sec. When we estimate, there's a range of acceptable answers. In this case, any number between 1.5 and 1.9 is a reasonable estimate.       Where was Team A after 5 seconds?    How long did it take Team A to go 20 m?        You will also need to know how to find average speed. Average speed is . For example, if I drove 100 miles in 2 hours, then my average speed was . Another example is that if after 2 hours, I was 100 mi from home and after 5 hours, I was 210 miles from home, then my average speed between hour 2 and hour 5 was     What was Team A's average speed between 5 and 10 seconds into the race?    What was Team A's average speed between 1.6 and 3.9 seconds into the race?     You'll need to be able to do the following things for this lesson.

It's a little closer to 2 than to 1, we estimate that our answer is 1.6 sec. When we estimate, there's a range of acceptable answers. In this case, any number between 1.5 and 1.9 is a reasonable estimate.       Where was Team A after 5 seconds?    How long did it take Team A to go 20 m?   "

Data Set 1    Input  Output    -4  -4    -2  2    0  8    2  14    4  20      Data Set 2    Input  Output    10  2    20  10    40  26    80  58    160  122      Data Set 3    Input  Output    -5  3    0  4.5    5  7.5    10  12    15  18         The vertical intercept of a mathematical model is the value where the graph crosses the vertical axis. It is also called the initial value because it is the output when the input is 0. What is the vertical intercept of your graph in part (e)?    Suppose that Theo used kWh of energy in a summer month. Find a formula for , Theo's bill.  Reminder: is read of and is NOT multiplication; is the name of the function, is the input, and all together is the output. In this context, is the kWh of energy that Theo used, and is the amount of money he owes.    How do the slope and vertical intercept of the linear model appear in your formula in part (b)?    Write a sentence describing how to build a formula to find the output of a linear model from its slope, vertical intercept, and an input value.    Suppose a family makes a quarterly (3-month) budget to plan for upcoming expenses. This family estimates they will use an average of 1000 kWh per month in July, August and September. How much money must the family set aside in the budget so that they will be able to pay for the electricity they will use during the three-month period? Round to the nearest dollar, since budgets are only estimates.        A local coffee shop offers a coffee card that you can preload with any amount of money and use like a debit card each day to purchase coffee. At the beginning of the month (when they get their paycheck), Arlo loads it with $50. Their favorite small soy latte costs $2.63.    Arlo purchases a latte every weekday. Estimate whether the amount of money they loaded onto their coffee card will last until the end of the month.    Explain why a linear model would describe the amount of money Arlo has left on their card.    What is the vertical intercept for the linear model? The slope? How do you know?    Let be the amount Arlo has left on their coffee card and be the number of latte's they've purchased. Find a formula for the linear model relating and .    Sketch a graph of your linear model.   Relationship between Latte Purchase and Amount Left on Card    Blank axes. The horizontal axis is labeled lattes and ranges from 0 to 25. The vertical axis is labeled $ and ranges from 0 to 50.   Blank axes.       A horizontal intercept of a mathematical model is the value where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. It tells us the input value that has an output value of 0. What is the horizontal intercept of this model?    Will Arlo's card last until the end of the month? If so, how much is left? If not, how many days will it last? (Note: There are about 22 weekdays in a month.)        Many old comic books contained ads offering money-making schemes to children reading the comics. As an example, suppose a company offered to send 30 greeting cards to a child to sell to relatives, friends, and neighbors. The child was to sell them for dollars each, and had to send dollars back to the company. Here is a graph of a linear model representing the situation. The input (horizontal value) represents the number of cards sold, and the output (vertical value) represents the child's profit in dollars.   Relationship between Latte Purchase and Amount Left on Card    The horizontal axis is ranges from -3 to 42. The vertical axis is ranges from -13 to 16. The graph shows a line with vertical intercept -10 and horizontal intercept 20.   Blank axes.       Find a formula for , the child's profit, in terms of , the number of comics they sell.  Hint: What information do you need to find a formula for a linear model?    What are and in the story?    What is the horizontal intercept? What does it represent in the context of this problem?    How much money will the child earn if they sell all 30 cards?        Data plans for cell phone plans can be purchased in two different ways. One is an unlimited data plan where the customer pays a set monthly fee for unlimited data. The other is a per-gigabyte (GB) pricing service where the customer pays a set monthly fee plus a specified amount for each GB. The GBs are not prorated (that means it doesn't matter if the customer uses 0.001 GB or 1 GB, they must still pay for the entire 1 GB). The cost of the phone itself and other fees are the same amount under each plan.  Ximena is shopping for a data plan and needs to decide which option costs less.  Per-GB Pricing: There is a monthly fee of $20 plus $10 per GB.  Unlimited Data: The unlimited plan costs $60 per month.      Which plan do you think is less expensive and why?    Let be the monthly cost for the per-GB pricing plan and be the number of gigabytes used. Create the linear model for in terms of .    Let be the monthly cost for the unlimited pricing plan and be the number of gigabytes used. Create the linear model for in terms of .    Sketch both of your linear models on the same graph.

These activities will introduce the idea of linear trends, which we'll spend more time in class. They'll also provide practice with building a linear model by identifying its slope and vertical intercept.     Several years ago, Onondaga Community College, in upstate New York, introduced a meal plan that included Flex Dollars that were stored on students' ID cards. Each student was given $150 Flex Dollars as part of their meal plan package that could be used like cash at several campus dining locations.

Smartphones, like many other manufactured goods, depreciate on a daily basis. Depreciation means how much an item (e.g. a smartphone) loses in value compared to the price that was originally paid for it from the manufacturer. There tends to be two main periods in a smartphone's life when it sees the biggest drops in value: 1. the period of time after the phone is initially purchased, and 2. when the manufacturer launches a new model.  In September 2019, the iPhone 11 256GB was released with a price of $849. Twelve months after the launch, it was found that the value of iPhone 11s depreciated about 37% (which is actually better than most smartphone depreciation!).   Suppose Coraline bought a new iPhone 11 256GB in September 2019 for $849. The phone would soon start depreciating in value.

  "body": " Linear Trends Activities     In 2022, Nelson created the following graph to represent his annual pay over the years.   Nelson's Annual Pay    Pay in 2012 was $24,000. In 2013 it was about $25,000. In 2014 it was about $27,000. In 2015 it was about $27,500. In 2016 it was about $28,500. In 2017 it was about $28,500. In 2018 it was about $29,000. In 2019 it as about $30,000. In 2020 it was about $31,000. In 2021 it was about $31,500. In 2022 it was $32,000.   Graph showing annual pay in each year between 2012 and 2022.       Find a linear equation that approximately models the above situation. Use to represent Nelson's pay in dollars and to represent the number of years since 2012.    If the trend continues, in what year would he expect to earn $36,000 a year?    Nelson is using extrapoloation to predict his future salary, so his prediction is unlikely to be perfect and could even be quite a bit off. Extrapolation is the process of using a mathematical model to make predictions that are outside the range of the available data, based on the assumption that existing trends will continue. The problem with extrapolation is that the trend could change in the future, for any number of reasons, which would make the prediction unreliable. Give at least one example of way that the trend in Nelson's salary might change and result his prediction being very wrong.        The following table shows the average weight for infant boys:    Average Weight of Boys, Ages 10 - 20 months    Age (months)  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20    Weight (kg)  9.2  9.4  9.7  9.9  10.1  10.3  10.5  10.7  10.9  11.1  11.4       Explain why a linear model could be created and used to fairly accurately calculate the average weight of an infant boy, given his age in months.    Create a linear model for the weight of infant boys.    Use your model to predict the weight of a 14.5-month-old boy. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.    Use your model to predict the weight of a 2-year-old boy. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.    Use your model to predict the weight of a 25-year-old man. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.    Every year, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project releases an analysis of land-surface temperature records (some going back as far as 250 years). According to Berkeley Earth, The analysis shows that the rise [or growth] in average world land temperature[is]... about 1.3 degrees Celsius. BEST states that global warming is real, and attributes the temperature trend to a combination of volcanoes and CO 2 .  There are others who are skeptical of the theory of global warming and hold a contrary view of weather data. These people believe that there are other explanations and reasons for the climate changes being experienced. In the next two activities, we are going to examine the Berkeley Earth project data and linear models for Global Surface Temperature Change to study the issue of global warming.  On the website , the data from the Berkeley Earth project has been used as the source for two different analyses of the same information. The first one is labeled How Realists View Global Warming > and the other is How Contrarians View Global Warming. The two infographics are reproduced here. You will see that each includes a line or line segments along with the actual data. Use these infographics to answer the following questions.      Below is an infographic showing the data gathered by BEST showing the monthly Global Temperature Anomaly (that is, the change in average Global Temperature, in degrees Celsius) for the years 1970-2022. It is stated on the project's website that the baseline period is the 1850-1900 mean. This means that the data from 1970-2022 is compared with the data from 1850-1900.   Difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a trendline. Image from Quantway College Module M.3 by Carnegie Math Pathways   Graph showing the difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a trendline.   The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. Exact points on the trend line are hard to estimate, but it appears that (1970, 0.21) and (2022, 1.28) are both approximately on the line.     Shown on the graph is a trendline, also known as a line of best fit, that is a linear model representing the trend of the data.    What are the units on the horizontal axis? What is the variable?    What are the units on the vertical axis? What is the variable?    What does one point on the graph represent?    Now look at the trendline that is drawn on the graph. What does this line represent?    Do you think the trendline is reasonable? Does it represent the trends in the data?    Estimate the value where the trendline crosses the vertical axis (we will treat this as the value in 1970). Describe the meaning of the point where the trendline crosses the vertical axis.    Estimate the slope of this line in degrees Celsius per year (although the original data is monthly, the slope will be per year). Write an interpretation of the slope in this context. Be sure to use units with your values, and use complete sentences. Finding exact points on this line is difficult. Just do your best to estimate two points and use them to find the slope.    Using your own estimates, estimate the equation of the line.    What is the model saying about the general pattern of the global temperature. Is it rising or falling?    Using your linear equation from above, predict the temperature change at the end of 2030. Also predict the temperature change at the end of 2050. Do you think this is a reliable prediction for 2050? Why or why not? Explain using complete sentences.        The infographic below contains the same data points for the Global Temperature Change (the change in average Global Temperature in the years from 1970-2022) that were included in the infographic showing How Realists View Global Warming. This infographic is meant to depict a common view stated by contrarians that global warming is not real since there have been several periods over the last 50 years when global temperatures have declined on average.   Difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a piecewise model. Image from Quantway College Module M.3 by Carnegie Math Pathways   Graph showing the difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a piecewise model.   The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. There are seven short-term trendlines shown, each of which is either decreasing or roughly horizontal. The trend line from 2010 to 2015 starts at about (2010, 1.1) and ends at about (2015, 0.9).     Also shown is a piecewise model, which is a model defined by multiple pieces, each of which has its own trendline that represents the trend of the data within a certain interval. This infographic shows a linear piecewise model that consists of 7 line segments - each of which can be considered a trendline for that restricted time period.    Look at the line segments that are drawn on the graph. What do these lines represent as a whole?    Now look at just the segment of the piecewise best fit model from 2010 to 2015 (the line segment second farthest to the right). Estimate where the line segment would cross the vertical axis (in year 1970). (Hint: It might be useful to use a straight-edged item to extend the line to the vertical axis. You can see the line is very slightly slanted.)    What is the slope value of the 2010 to 2015 line segment? Give an interpretation of the slope value.    Estimate the equation of the 2010 to 2015 line segment.    Could we use the equation of the 2010 to 2015 line segment to predict the mean Global Surface Temperature Change in 2035? Why or why not?    Explain what the Contrarian Model is saying about the general pattern of global temperature. Is it rising or falling? Think about this on your own for a minute before sharing your ideas in your group.    If you look at the overall trend of the data in the infographic, it is increasing. However, each line segment in the piecewise model is decreasing (ever so slightly). What does this mean? Explain what the model is saying about the general pattern of global temperature change.    Come up with an example of a similar piecewise linear model. Note that models can be represented in different ways - tables, graphs, written descriptions, or equations. We will explore piecewise models in the next lesson.     "

Now, let's consider the cost of electricity in and around Denver in the winter. Use the information given in the table above to build a linear model for the bill amount, , of a customer that uses kWh in the winter.    The company that provides electricity to people in and around New Orleans, Louisiana is called Entergy. The table below estimates the winter monthly rates charged by Entergy . Let be the monthly bill amount and be the number of kWh used.

Build a linear model for the bill , of a customer that used 800 kWh or less.   Build a linear model for the bill , of a customer that used more than 800 kWh.        The situation in is called piecewise defined or a piecewise linear model. It is piecewise because the cost changes based on the amount of electricity used. Cost per kWh is not constant, so the graph of this situation is not a line. But it is piecewise linear, because cost per kWh is constant on each piece.  We found that when the number of kilowatt hours used, is 800 or less, the bill is . When the number of kilowatt hours used is more than 800, , or . Mathematicians like to put both of these equations together like this: The { symbol is there to tell you that this is a piecewise formula. The at the end of the first line tells you to use that part of the formula when is 800 or less. The at the end of the second line tells you to use that part of the formula when is bigger than 800.    Use the piecewise formula to find the bill for customers who used 600 kWh, 900 kWh, and 1200 kWh. You should get the same answers as you did in     Graph this piecewise linear model.

These values could be, for example, the weight of the same person at two different points in time, or the age of the previous governor and the age of the current governor.  The absolute change tells us by how much the two values differ. We can find the absolute change using the formula where Old is the starting value and New is the ending value.  The relative change is the absolute change compared to the reference value (typically, the earlier quantity). Relative change is often given as a percentage. We can find the relative change using the formula . We often multiply by 100 to express relative change as a percentage.  Think carefully about what change you are trying to measure! To measure a relative change, you'll need to understand which value constitutes the starting value , reference value or old value and which constitutes the ending value , final value or new value . The context and the surrounding language in a question help to clarify which is which.     An article about the 2016 presidential election stated: Trump lost the popular vote by about 2.1 percentage points. Meanwhile, Trump racked up 306 electoral voters - 14 percent more than Clinton. Answer the following questions about this statement.    Does 2.1 percentage points refer to an absolute or a relative change?    Does 14 percent more refer to an absolute or a relative change?

Lucian is a Sales Associate at a retail store for a cell phone provider. His company offers many opportunities for growth in the organization. Lucian is starting some long-term planning and wants to decide if he should stay with this company and seek a promotion, or if he wants to explore other options with another company, or even try a new career.  Lucian has access to the following data from the past seven years about typical salaries for Sales Associates, Sales Supervisors, and Regional Sales Managers. Notice that salaries do not always increase from one year to the next. Lucian wants to get a better idea about how the salaries change over time for each of these positions, to gain insight into his earning potential if he stays with his current company.

Which position had the greatest relative increase in salary? Write an explanation for what you observe in the absolute changes and relative changes.        One way to systematically look at a large set of relative changes over time is to create an index . You'll compute a salary index to help Lucian's career discernment. A salary index will look like a table of numbers that answer the question, The salary for this year is what percent of the base year ?    Use the salary information from the earlier to create a salary index for each of the three positions. You will be creating three separate indices, one for Sales Associate, one for Sales Supervisor, and one for Regional Sales Manager. Use 2016 as the base year, and round each answer to the nearest tenth.

Blank axes.            Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the buying power of currency is falling. In other words, if everything else (rent, groceries, utilities, etc.) gets more expensive, but your salary stays the same, your buying power decreases. To account for that, some state and private sector employees get annual salary adjustments, often referred to as Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA).  Suppose Gracelyn's pre-tax income was $65,800 in 2022.    Gracelyn spent $41,000 on expenses in 2022. What percent of her income did she spend on expenses?    Gracelyn spent $45,000 on expenses in 2023. How much would she have needed to make in 2023 in order to have the same buying power, i.e. in order to spend the same percent of her income on expenses as she did in 2022?       The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often used in the US to measure inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI every month by looking at the prices of a collection of goods and services, including cars and housing. The inflation rate is the relative change in the CPI.  The average price of a new car in 1945 was $1,020. The Consumer Price Index was 18.0 in 1945 and 271.0 in 2021. Use this information to answer the following question: $1,020 in 1945 has the same buying power as how many dollars in 2021?   Hint: Start by finding the relative change in the CPI. There are several steps to this problem - you know how to do all of them individually! This problem is about practicing putting together steps without being told what they are.     The table below lists the U.S. national debt at various times in history. We need to adjust these figures for inflation. Adjusting them will allow us to more accurately compare the sizes of these debts to one another.    Use the Consumer Price Index to adjust the national debt for each year so that the debt is expressed in 2021 dollars. Enter the adjusted amounts in the table below. Round to two decimal places.   Adjusting the National Debt for Inflation    Year  National Debt (Billion $)  CPI (average annual)  Relative Change from Year to 2021  National Debt Adjusted for Inflation (Billion 2021 $)    1945  259  18.0      1980  930  82.4      1995  4,974  152.4      2010  14,025  218.1      2021  28,429  271.0  0%  28,429       When adjusted for inflation, in which year was the national debt largest? smallest?        Now let us consider a different approach to analyzing the U.S. national debt over time. Just as the cost of dinner and a movie for a person before and after college can be compared as a percentage of their income, economists frequently compare the national debt at different times in history by measuring it as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The GDP is the estimated value of all the goods and services that are produced in a country in a given year.    Fill in the table below with the national debt as a percentage of each year‚Äôs GDP. Round to the nearest percentage point.   Comparing the National Debt to GDP    Year  National Debt (Billion $)  GDP (Billion $)  National Debt as Percent of GDP    1945  259  228     1980  930  2,857     1995  4,974  7.640     2010  14,025  15,049     2021  28,429  23,315        After adjusting the debt relative to GDP, in which year was the national debt the largest? In which year was the debt smallest? ( Note: In this case, we say the national debts are being compared in relative terms.)    Is it better to measure the national debt in absolute terms or relative terms? Write a brief explanation.      When communicating information about very large numbers like the national debt, it can be useful to use tools like infographics and comparing sizes of real objects.    When communicating quantitative information, an infographic can be a useful tool. In order to help people understand the national debt adjusted to 2021 dollar amounts, we can draw bags of money to illustrate the change. If we use a 4 cm segment (4 bags of money) to represent the 1945 national debt adjusted for inflation (see figure below), how long should the segments be for each of the other years' national debt after adjusting to 2021 amounts? Round your answers to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.    According to the U.S. Treasury Department, a one-hundred-dollar bill is 0.0043 inches thick. Therefore, a stack of 100 one-hundred-dollar bills would be 0.43 inches thick. Assume that we could create stacks of one-hundred-dollar bills that would never topple over, no matter the height. How tall is the stack of money that represents each year's inflation-adjusted national debts?       "

  "body": " Building Exponential Models Activities     We have seen that when a quantity increases or decreases by the same amount for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as a linear model. That is, linear models have a constant average rate of change. For example, think of getting a $500 raise every year.  When a quantity increases or decreases by the same percentage for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as an exponential model . Exponential models have a constant relative change. For example, think of getting a 3% raise every year.  Determine which of the data sets below have a linear model, which have an exponential model, and which have neither.

All three towns had a population of 5500 in 2010, but their populations were changing in different ways:  Indiana: Increasing by 2.5% each year  Ohio: Decreasing by 2.5% each year  Michigan: Decreasing by 150 people each year      Determine which town's population has a linear model. Explain your answer, and find a formula for the population of this town years after 2010.    The populations of the other two towns have an exponential model. Explain how we know this from the verbal description of the change in the towns' populations.    In the Prep Activity, you found the populations of all three towns in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2020. Plot the populations of all three towns on the graph below. What do you notice?   Populations of Three Small Towns    Blank axes. The horizontal axis is labeled with the years between 0 and 10. The vertical axis goes from 3900 to 7100.   Blank axes.       Find formulas for the populations of the two towns with exponential models.        List at least two other situations where quantities, besides population, can have constant relative change and be represented with an exponential model, and explain your reasoning.    Create an algebraic formula that represents the changing values over time for each of your examples.    What is exponential about these exponential models?      Suppose that the cost of attending a certain four-year private college (tuition and fees) was $16,500 in 1977 and that the cost increased about 3.2% every year.    Create an algebraic model, or formula, that could be used to estimate the cost of attending this college over time.    According to your model, what would be the tuition and fees for 1987, 1997, and 2022? Round your answers to the nearest dollar.    How many years from 1977 did it take for the total cost of tuition and fees to double? To triple?    If the original cost of attending the college in 1977 was only $12,000, how would the doubling and tripling time change?    Explain one strategy you could use to determine the year when this model would predict a cost of $42,000. Assume we are using the original cost of $16,500 for 1977.        The rate of elimination of caffeine from the human body varies greatly from individual to individual. Suppose that Jacob drinks a 16-ounce coffee drink that contains about 310 mg of caffeine. His body eliminates about 13% of the caffeine every hour. Hint: Assume all caffeine is absorbed into the body as soon as the coffee is drunk.    Create an algebraic model for this situation. Let be the number of hours after drinking a 16-oz cup of coffee, and let be the amount of caffeine in your body.    How much caffeine would be in Jacob's body right after he drank a second 16-ounce coffee drink, exactly three hours after drinking the first one?    Approximately how long will it take for Jacob's body to eliminate half of the caffeine from one 16-ounce coffee drink?   Try to use algebra to answer this question! What happens?   Use a graphing utility to create a precise graphical model of the amount of caffeine in Jacob's body from one 16-ounce coffee drink. Use your graph to answer the question. Include a sketch of your graph and the steps you used to find the answer here.    If Jacob drank a 12-ounce Pepsi containing 38 mg of caffeine instead of the coffee drink, how long will it take for Jacob's body to eliminate half of the caffeine? Write your answer rounded to the nearest whole hour.        For each scenario below, find an algebraic formula to model the scenario and then use Desmos or another graphing device to create a graph. Use your formula and\/or a graph to answer the question about the scenario.    Shawn's brand new Dodge Charger valued at $52,250 depreciates at the rate of 8% per year. He plans to sell it in 5 years. How much will it be worth then?    Fletcher currently exercises for about an hour per week. They'd like to exercise for the recommended 150 minutes per week. They know that they're more likely to sustain the change if they slowly increase the amount they're exercising each week instead of trying to jump from one hour to 150 minutes. If Fletcher increases how much they exercise by 20 minutes each week, how many weeks will it take them to get to their goal of 150 minutes per week?    Melany's starting salary is $55,000, and she will be getting a 2% pay raise every year. How many years will it take for her salary to be $60,000?    Joan quit her job at GM when she was 35 years old. Her friend, who is a financial advisor, recommended that she leave her 401(k) retirement savings in GM's retirement plan rather than withdrawing or transferring the money to a new plan. Her friend said that, on average, Joan could expect a 6% increase per year if she left her money in the plan for many years, based on the past performance of GM's plan. Joan will not be able to add more money to the GM 401(k) account, but can open a new one at her new job. How long will it take for the amount of money Joan has in the GM 401(k) to double?        The half-life of a substance with an exponential model is the amount of time it takes for half of the substance to be eliminated. For example, the half-life of a drug in the blood in the amount of time it takes for half of the drug to be elminiated from the body, and the half-life of a radioactive element is the amount of time it takes for half of the starting amount to decay.    If the half-life of a certain drug is 3 hours, and 25 mg of the drug is in the blood at 5 pm, how much of the drug will be in the blood at 8 pm? How long will it take for there to be 6.25 mg of the drug left in the blood?    Earlier, we assumed that the body could eliminate 13% of the caffeine present every hour. Wikipedia states that the half-life of caffeine in a healthy adult is often between 4.9 and 6 hours. If 13% of the caffeine is eliminated every hour, does this imply a half-life between 4.9 and 6 hours? Explain.    The antibiotic tetracycline is used for treatment against many different bacterial infections. Suppose that an individual is given 300 mg of tetracycline per dose, and the half-life of tetracycline is 8 hours. Assume all tetracycline is absorbed into the body immediately.   Use that the half-life of tetracycline is 8 hours to fill in the table below.

After performing this step, you arrive at the solution, .     Now we would like to introduce a new operation which undoes exponentiation. That operation is written as , and we say this as the log of x .  The term log is an abbreviation for the mathematical term logarithm . A logarithm is a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.  For example, a logarithm, or log operation, can be used to find the exponent to which one must raise the number 10 to get the specific number as the output.  The expression is then equal to , since .  The expression is then equal to , since .  The expression is then equal to , since .    Most scientific and graphing calculators have a button or function labeled Log which performs this calculation. Calculators will assume that the base is 10 unless you specifically ask them to use a different base. We'll stick with base 10 for now.    What are the following logs?                Now we would like to use the log operation to solve equations. Consider the equation . Notice that the exponent is not a whole number in this case. We can still solve this equation by doing something to both sides of the equation, as we did in .

  "body": " The Log Operation Activities    We use opposite operations to solve equations. If you can see what operations are currently applied to a variable, you can do the opposite operations to solve the equation - to find out what number the variable stands for. Some examples of operations in math are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising a number to a power, and taking a root of a number (such as the square root).  Fill in the column on the right in the table below:      If you have an equation like...  ...you can solve it by using the opposite operation.  Write the operation you would use to solve the equation, and then solve it.                              Now, consider the following example. Even though both equations include the same numbers and the same variable, they are fundamentally different. It's all about the placement of a variable.   The equation on the left is a cubic equation; the variable is in the base of .  The equation on the right is an exponential equation; the variable is in the exponent of    Variable as Base vs. Variable as Exponent    Given equation      Given operation  The variable is cubed.  is raised to the power of     An equation that has a variable in the exponent is called an exponential equation. Sometimes, we can solve such equations by inspection . This means we look at an equation and see what number could go in place of the variable to make the equation true, such as in the equation ,where we know that because .   Note: If a problem asks you to solve an equation by inspection, but you don't have that arithmetic fact memorized and don't see the answer, that's okay! In that case, use the instruction to solve by inspection as a hint that the answer is probably a small nice number, and solve by guess and check instead.    Solve the equations below by inspection.                  In , we saw that we can also undo the operation in an exponential equation using logarithms, which are often referred to as logs. We learned to use the log operation to solve equations when the base is the number 10 (such as ).  Solve the equations below. Think about the operation you would use to solve the equation first and then solve it. Round to the nearest thousandth.              What if the base isn't 10? For example, consider the examples You might be able to use inspection to see that the solution to is because you remember that , but the answers to the other two examples are not nice numbers. To solve this problem, we have to tell our calculator to use a base other than 10 for our log. We write for the log base operation. The log base operation finds the exponent of that gives us the number we're looking for. For example,   The expression is equal to , since .  The expression is equal to , since .  The expression is equal to , since .   The log base operation let us solve and . Desmos can evaluate logs with any base and give us a number. Click on the functions button in the keyboard and scroll until you find . Pressing on will add log to an entry line and let you enter the base and the number.    To solve , we see that the base is 3 and we want to get 25, so we need , which we read as log base 3 of 25 . Desmos tells us that . Since , it seems like we probably got the right answer, since that tiny a difference is probably just rounding.    To solve , we see that the base is 1.05 and we want to get 1.6, so we need , which we read as log base 1.05 of 1.6 . Desmos tells us that . Since , it seems like we probably got the right answer, since that tiny a difference is probably just rounding.    Your calculator might have a log base button, but it also might not. If it doesn't, you should use Desmos for these types of problems.       Solve each of the equations below. Round to the nearest thousandth, and double check your answers.                     We looked at the following scenario in :   Suppose that the cost of attending a certain four-year private college (tuition and fees) was $16,500 in 1977 and that the cost increased about 3.2% every year.   We found that is a formula that models this situation where is tuition and is years since 1977. We then thought about how we might determine the year when tuition would reach $42,000. We considered various methods, such as guess-and-check (guessing different values and checking the results), to find a solution to the equation: .    In what year is tuition predicted to be $42,000? Use an algebraic strategy to find the answer.    What method could you use to determine whether your solution is correct? Explain your method, then use it to check your answer.        We also modeled the amount of caffeine Jacob has left in his body several hours after drinking a 16-oz coffee drink in . Suppose that Jacob has just consumed a 16-ounce cup of coffee containing 300 mg of caffeine.    If caffeine is being eliminated from Jacob's body at a rate of 13% every hour, how long before three quarters of the caffeine has been eliminated? Enter your answer rounded to the nearest hour. ( Hint: First, set up a model for the situation and then use it to answer the question.)    How much caffeine will be in Jason‚Äôs blood if he drinks another 16-ounce cup of coffee 5 hours after the first?     Exponential equations are often seen when working with accounts or loans that use compound interest. Compound interest occurs when interest is calculated on both the initial principal and any accumulated interest from previous periods. (Note: For comparison, recall that simple interest does not take into account the accumulated interest, that is, the interest each year is only based on the initial principal.) The equation for computing the amount of a loan, or in an account, that uses compound interest (assuming no change in principal) is where  represents the total amount of the loan or in the account.  represents the principal (initial amount of the loan or money put into the account).  represents the interest rate, written as a decimal.  represents the number of compounding periods per year.  represents the term of the loan in years or time since opening the account in years.   Suppose that you take out a $2000 loan with a compound interest rate of 4%, compounded annually (once a year). If you make no payments, and interest compounds annually, in how many years will the loan balance double (reach or surpass $4000)? Think about this on your own for a minute before sharing your ideas in your group.     A log is an operation that combines two numbers to make a new number. The log operation combines the base and a target, and gives us back the exponent that we need to raise the base to to get the target. Just like when you learned the raise to the power of operation in a previous math class, practice is the key to feeling comfortable with this new operation.      Let's pratice using the relationship between logs and exponents to rewrite equations. The key idea to use is that   The equation is equivalent to the equation .   Rewrite each of the log equations as exponential equations, and each of the exponetial equations as log equations.                          In real applications, we nearly always use Desmos or another calculator to evaluate logs. But, evaluating logs without a calculator is a useful practice drill when we're first learning logs. This is uncomfortable at first, but it makes our brains think about what a log means and helps us to feel more comfortable using logs in the future. Don't use a calculator for this activity , except to check your answer! The purpose of this activity isn't to get the answers, but to practice thinking about how the log operation works.  Evaluate each of the log operations below.                          Milo's homework includes the problem , and he keeps getting it wrong. He doesn't understand why - he's entering it into Google's calculator, so it HAS to be right. He presses the log button, then 5, then closes the parentheses, then times, then 100.

Basically, current workers pay into the program (a portion of their paycheck is automatically deducted for this purpose) and people who are retired receive payments from this program, based on their income while they worked. The following text is from a March 2023 NPR story. Please read the excerpt and answer the questions.    Social Security is now expected to run short of cash by 2033   The Social Security program is expected to run short of cash to pay promised benefits in about ten years, while a key trust fund for Medicare will run out of funds by 2031, according to new forecasts issued Friday by trustees of both programs. Social Security benefits for retirees and others are primarily paid for through payroll taxes on current workers, and are supplemented by a trust fund.  Benefits paid out by the program have exceeded money coming in since 2021, and the trust fund is now expected to be depleted by 2033. That's a year earlier than forecast last year, thanks in part to slower economic growth.  Unless changes are made before then to shore up the program, 66 million Social Security recipients would see their benefits cut by 23-25%.  Meanwhile, the Medicare trust fund, which supplements payments to hospitals and nursing homes, is also running out of cash. That could result in an 11% pay cut to health care providers unless changes are made by 2031. That deadline is three years later than had been forecast last year.   Millions depend on Social Security, Medicare   Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who leads the trustees, stressed the importance of propping up both trust funds to avoid draconian cuts in benefits and provider payments.  \"Social Security and Medicare are two bedrock programs that older Americans rely upon for their retirement security,\" Yellen said in a statement. \"The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring the long-term viability of these critical programs so that retirees can receive the hard-earned benefits they're owed.\"  The primary challenge for Social Security is demographic. As aging baby boomers retire, there are fewer workers paying into the program to support the rising cost of benefits. As of last year, there were just 2.7 workers paying into the system for each person drawing Social Security benefits.  Additionally, a smaller fraction of income is now subject to the payroll taxes that support Social Security.  Patching the program will require higher taxes, lower benefits or some combination of the two.  \"The only responsible thing to do is admit that we've got to make changes and we disagree about how to do it but let's sit down and try to figure those out,\" said Maya Macguineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"If we wait until the last minute, they'll be much, much harder.\"        What is the main point of this article?    Why has the Social Security Administration been paying out more money than expected?    What does the article suggest needs to be done to address these issues?

  "body": " Applications of Exponential Models Activities    Social Security is an insurance program. Workers pay into the program, typically through payroll withholding where they work. They can earn up to four credits each year. In 2023, you receive 1 credit for each $1,640 of earnings, up to the maximum of 4 credits per year. That money goes into two Social Security trust funds (OASI and DI) where it is used to pay benefits to people currently eligible for them. The money that is not spent remains in the trust funds.    To qualify for Social Security retirement benefits, workers must be at least 62 and have paid into the system for 10 years or more.    Workers who wait to collect Social Security, up to age 70, will receive higher monthly benefits.  Spouses and ex-spouses may also be eligible for benefits, based on their former partner's earnings record.   The Social Security Trust Funds hold the accumulated savings of the U. S. Social Security system. By law, the funds are invested in the general debt of the United States government, entirely in U.S. Treasury securities.  Projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees (the trustees) show that Social Security expenditures will exceed tax revenues each year through the end of the 75-year valuation period (ending in 2097).     One measure that analysts use to determine the strength of the Social Security Trust Fund finances is the Trust Fund Ratio . For example, in 2010 the asset reserves of the Social Security trust fund were $2.5 trillion and the total cost of the program that year was $706.3 billion, so the Trust Fund Ratio was 354%. Another way of saying this is that the trust fund asset reserves were 3.54 times greater than the cost of the program. The Trust Fund Ratio indicates how much of recipients‚Äô annual benefit amounts could be paid from the balance at the beginning of a given year. When the Trust Fund Ratio drops below 100%, then this means that the fund is unable to pay out the total benefits due.    From 2010 to 2019, the Trust Fund Ratio declined 7.7 percentage points each year. The Trust Fund Ratio in 2010 was 354%. Using 354 as the starting amount, create a linear model and determine in what year the model predicts the Trust Fund Ratio to fall below 100. Your model can be a table, a graph, or an equation.    Use the Trust Fund Ratio information for 2020 and 2022 in the table below to create a linear model and determine in what year the model predicts the Trust Fund Ratio to fall below 100. Round the slope to one decimal place.   Trust Fund Ratio 2020 - 2022    Year  2020  2021  2022    Trust Fund Ratio (%)  265  256  234         Comparing our answers from the two parts of , we can see that using more recent data (2020 to 2022) suggests that the Trust Fund Ratio will be depleted sooner than what the 2010 to 2019 data suggested.  It is projected that in 2023, the Trust Fund Ratio will be anywhere between 204% to 219%. Furthermore, some projections suggest that the funds will drop below 100 (96%) in 2029, which means that full payments to retirees cannot be met, and then it will drop to zero (trust fund asset reserve depletion) around 2034.    Social Security Trust Funds Over Time - Real Past and Projected Future   Graph showing the trust fund ratio in the past, and projected in the future   The graph shows OASI and Combined OASI and DI declining to 0 sometime between 2031 and 2035.       Let's now explore what projected trust fund asset reserves suggest about when the fund will be unable to meet its benefit pay out obligations. The Congressional Research Service stated that at the end of 2022, the trust fund asset reserves were valued at around $2.83 trillion. Using projection figures from the 2023 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees for the OASI and DI funds for 2023 and onward, we can estimate that the asset reserves of the Social Security trust fund is going to decline about 15% each year (as a result of paying out more than is being brought in).    Assume the 15% yearly decline estimates are correct, and create a model for the yearly value of the trust fund asset reserves after 2.83 trillion dollars was reached in 2022. Your model can be a table, a graph, or an equation.    How much will the trust funds decrease in the first year after 2022?    How long will it take for the value of the trust funds to decline to half of $2.83 trillion? In what year will that occur?        Using projection data, when the trust fund drops below 400 billion dollars there will not be enough money to cover the benefits due to retirees. Use your Trust Funds Model from to find when this will occur.    If additional funds are added to the Trust Funds as a result of policy changes, so that the value of the funds in 2022 is $5 trillion, how long would it take for the value of the funds to shrink to half?    With a fund value of $5 trillion in 2022, when would these funds drop below 400 billion dollars?    What amount of money is needed in the trust funds in 2022 so that the value will not drop below 400 billion dollars until 2042? You can create an equation to model this scenario with a variable for the unknown starting amount (in trillions), and using a repeated 15% decrease for 20 years. This equation is: Solve the equation. What is the starting amount, ?    What are some important factors that might contribute to the decline that is projected in the value of the Social Security Trust Funds?    What could be done to address the problem of the decline in the value of the Trust Fund?    Some assumptions were made in order to produce the Trust Funds Model in . These assumptions are based on predictions of a future some years off, and could be somewhat inaccurate. However, they are still the best assumptions that could be made at the time and are much better than random guesses. Make a list of these assumptions.        The 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act established a federal minimum wage of $0.25 per hours in the United States. The federal minimum wage has been increased many times since it was established in 1938.  Using the federal minimum wage data from 1938 to 2009, we can estimate that the minimum wage increased, on average, by about 4.94% each year.   Find a formula to predict the federal minimum wage in year . Explain in words how you found your formula.   Use your formula to predict the federal minimum wage in 2009. How close did you get to the actual 2009 federal minimum wage of $7.25?    The federal minimum wage hasn't changed since 2009. If it had continued to increase at the same rate, what would the federal minimum wage be now?    The federal minimum wage increased much more frequently between 1938 and 1981 then it has since. If we use only the federal minimum wage data up to 1981, we find that it increased, on average, at about 6.14% per year during that time period. The data between 1938 and 1981 is also closer to fitting an exponential model than if we look at all of the data up to 2009. Find a new formula for the federal minimum wage in year based on this data.    Use your new formula to predict the federal minimum wage in 1981. How close did you get to the actual 1981 federal minimum wage of $3.35?    Suppose the minimum wage had continued to increase at the 1938 - 1981 rate up until 2009, and then stopped increasing. What would the federal minimum wage be in this scenario?    Suppose the minimum wage had continued to increase at the 1938 - 1981 rate up until now.

For example, in 2010 the asset reserves of the Social Security trust fund were $2.5 trillion and the total cost of the program that year was $706.3 billion, so the Trust Fund Ratio was 354%. Another way of saying this is that the trust fund asset reserves were 3.54 times greater than the cost of the program. The Trust Fund Ratio indicates how much of recipients‚Äô annual benefit amounts could be paid from the balance at the beginning of a given year. When the Trust Fund Ratio drops below 100%, then this means that the fund is unable to pay out the total benefits due.

  "body": " Exponential Trends Activities    We saw in that in the real world, it's more common to have data that is approximately linear than it is to have data that is exactly . The same thing is true of exponential models! Today, we will put the skills we've been learning together to find a formula for an exponential model for a data set with an exponential trend.  Exponential models are more sensitive to small differences in the relative change than linear models are to small differences in the average rate of change. This means that it's harder to get a good estimate for the relative change of approximately exponential data than it is to estimate the average rate of change of approximately linear data. To get around this problem, we'll use logs to turn approximately exponential data into approximately linear data, find a linear model for the log of our data, then use the raise 10 to the power of operation to get an exponential model for our original data.     The graph on the left below Chart made in Excel using data from: Hannah Ritchie, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao, Edouard Mathieu, Marcel Gerber, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Joe Hasell and Max Roser (2023) - \"Population Growth\" Published online at OurWorldInData.org.

Population   Graph showing the population in what is now the US between 1700 and 2023.

Graph showing the log of the population in what is now the US between 1700 and 2023..   The log of the population is roughly linear. It seems to be about 5.95 in 1700, and about 8.54 in 2023.         Explain why a linear model is not a good fit for the population data.    The trend of the data resembles the graphs of an increasing exponential model. Logs are often used to analyze trends when the data seems to grow exponentially. The graph above right shows the log of the population. The years are kept the same, but the vertical axis shows the log of the population instead of the population itself. A graph that takes the log of the data values on one of the two axes is called a semi-log graph .  Explain why a linear model IS a good fit for the log of the population data.    We can use either graph to estimate the US population in a year. For example, we see from the population data graph that the US population in 1990 was about 250 million. From the log population graph, we see that the log of the population in 1990 was about 8.4. If we let be the population, we get the log equation . As we learned in , this tells us that , which is about 250 million.  Estimate the US population in 1930 in two ways: (1) from the population data graph and (2) from the log of population data graph.        Here's the log of population graph again.

Population   Graph showing the population in what is now the US between 1700 and 2023.   The population appears to have grown exponentially, from a little under a million people in 1700 to about 343 million in 2023.      Log of US Population Between 1700 and 2023.   Graph showing the log of the population in what is now the US between 1700 and 2023..   The log of the population is roughly linear. It seems to be about 5.95 in 1700, and about 8.54 in 2023.         Explain why a linear model is not a good fit for the population data.    The trend of the data resembles the graphs of an increasing exponential model. Logs are often used to analyze trends when the data seems to grow exponentially. The graph above right shows the log of the population. The years are kept the same, but the vertical axis shows the log of the population instead of the population itself. A graph that takes the log of the data values on one of the two axes is called a semi-log graph .  Explain why a linear model IS a good fit for the log of the population data.    We can use either graph to estimate the US population in a year. For example, we see from the population data graph that the US population in 1990 was about 250 million. From the log population graph, we see that the log of the population in 1990 was about 8.4. If we let be the population, we get the log equation . As we learned in , this tells us that , which is about 250 million.  Estimate the US population in 1930 in two ways: (1) from the population data graph and (2) from the log of population data graph.   "
