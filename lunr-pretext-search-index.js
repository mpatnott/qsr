  "body": " Mathematical Models Activities    Media outlets regularly publish rankings of cell phone carriers, travel destinations, colleges, TVs, and credit cards, just to mention a few.  Here's an example of one such ranking - the Best Places to Retire on Earth , according to investopedia.com . To determine which countries are the best for retirees, they used a scoring system that measured seven categories:   Visa\/benefits  Climate  Cost of living  Development  Healthcare  Housing  Affinity rating   The top 4 countries with the highest cumulative average score across all those categories are Costa Rica, Portugal, Mexico, and Panama.  When creating rankings like the one above, we first need to decide what factors (variables) will contribute to the overall ranking. Then, we need to decide how those factors can be measured (quantified). Finally, we need a formula that combines all of them into one overall score.   Important factors for a decision or situation are called variables . Variables that have values that are numbers called quantitative variables .   In your group, agree on a topic that interests everyone (or most of you!), and try to come up with a strategy to create a ranking system related to that topic. After agreeing on a topic, think about:   What variables to use;  How to measure those variables; and  How to combine all of them into one overall score.      Every year, U.S. News & World Report publishes a list of the best colleges in the United States. Colleges on the list are ranked based on many different factors, such as first-year student retention, graduation rates, and faculty strength.     Using what you know about how U.S. News ranks colleges, discuss what things you might include in your decision in choosing a college. That is, what factors would be important to your decision?      Brainstorm how numeric values could be used to quantify (express with numbers) the variables you identified above. Include the units of measurement.       A mathematical model is a description of a system, or situation, using mathematical concepts, language, and numbers. People often use variables to help create mathematical models. Mathematical models can be represented as equations, tables, graphs, or descriptions in words.    Let's look at a mathematical model for ranking community colleges that combines variables to give us one number for each community college. The Aspen Institute awards the Aspen Prize every other year. The award honors those institutions that strive for and achieve exceptional levels of success for all students, while they are in college and after they graduate. In addition to the prestige of winning this award, the winning college also receives a $1 million cash prize. To determine the 150 finalists for the award, the Aspen Institute collects information from 1000 community colleges related to the following variables:  Performance - The performance score measures student success in persistence, degrees awarded, completion, and transfer;  Change - The change score measures consistent improvement in these areas over time; and  Minority Achievement and Family Income - The minority achievement score and family income score measure equitable outcomes for students of all racial\/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Each of these scores is created from combining a great deal of information about many factors.     Look at the scores in the table below for four community colleges. Which school do you think is the best? Why? (Hint: What data are you focusing on in the table?)     College  State  Performance  Change  Minority Achievement  Family Income     Bergen Community College  NJ  299  800  178  70     Miami Dade College  FL  323  400  288  191     Northwest Iowa Community College  IA  503  200  437  99     Pearl River Community College  MS  444  600  275  118          The Aspen institute used the following mathematical model equation to calculate a score for each school: where:  Overall ranking score (higher scores are best)  Performance score  Change score  Minority score  Family income score  Use this equation to calculate the overall score for each of the schools and enter it into the table above. According to the overall score you calculated, which school is best?         Body Mass Index, or BMI, is often used to classify people as obese or underweight. The formula for BMI is     What variables are used to calculate BMI?    A 2012 study found that the proportion of Americans that are severely obese was increasing. How do you think the researchers in this study obtained information about these variables? Imagine yourselves as the researchers. You will want a large, varied sample, and you have limited funds. What would be a good way to get people's height and weight from diverse U.S. locations?     If you want to determine whether someone is obese, are there any other variables that might be important to consider?      The table below lists known heights and weights of several current and former athletes. Calculate the BMI for each of the athletes. Use the fact that one inch is 0.0254 meters and one pound is about 0.454 kilograms.    Athlete  Height (ft & in)  Height (m)  Weight (lbs)  Weight (kg)  BMI ( )    Rory McIlroy (Golf)  5 ft 10 in   160      Julianna Penn (UFC)  5 ft 7 in   135      Cam Gallagher (Baseball)  6 ft 3 in   230      Breanna Stewart (WNBA)  6 ft 4 in   170      Shaquille O'Neal (NBA)  7 ft 1 in   325      Maria Sharapova (Tennis)  6 ft 2 in   130            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that  BMI below 18.5 is underweight  BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is normal  BMI between 25 and 29.9 is overweight  BMI of 30 and above is obsese  What are the athletes' classifications based on their BMIs? What does this suggest about limitations of the BMI model?      Consider the following two scenarios. In each scenario, which person has the lower BMI?   Marisol and Adelyn have the same weight, but Marisol is taller.  Aries and Niko have the same height, but Aries weighs more.          Most of the mathematical models that we'll explore in this class are functions . A function is a special type of mathematical model that matches each value of its input quantity to exactly one value of its output quantity. Mathematicians use a special notation for functions, , which is read of . It has three parts:    is the name of the function or model   is the input  all together is the output . If we have , then is also the output.    Identify the input, output, and function name in each of the math sentences below.                                  Function notation is a compact way to keep track of and connect several pieces of information. Let's practice interpreting it in an example.  The table below shows the percent of US adults (18+) who said they used Instagram in each year Data from Pew Research Center surveys on social media use. .   Percent of US Adults That Use Instagram    Year,  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2018  2019  2021  2023    Percent,  13  17  26  28  32  35  37  40  47     Using function notation, we can write the sentence 13% of US adults used Instagram in 2012 as .     Use function notation to write the sentence 47% of US adults used Instagram in 2023 .      Interpret by writing a sentence in words.      We can use the table to evaluate expressions in function notation. For example, if we're asked Evaluate , the table tells us the answer is .  Evaluate .      We can also use the table to solve equations in function notation. For example, if we're asked Solve the equation , the answer is , since that's the year in which of US adults used Instagram, according to the table.  Solve the equation .       We can also use function notation with graphs. In the graph below, let be the year, and be the life expetancy at birth in year . Data Page: Life expectancy at birth , part of the following publication: Saloni Dattani, Lucas Rodés-Guirao, Hannah Ritchie, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser (2023) - Life Expectancy .

You will also review finding average speed, which you will build on in this lesson.     There are many types of graphs in math! In previous courses, you may have seen:  Bar charts  Pie charts  Scatterplots  Graphs of functions in the plane  and more. When we talk about graphs in this class, we will always mean graphs of points or curves in the plane (unless we specifically say otherwise). We will use these graphs in almost every lesson, so it is essential that you know how to read and create them.     The graph below shows several points in the plane (aka coordinate plane). The horizontal axis goes from left to right and is the boldest left-to-right line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The vertical axis goes up and down and is the boldst up-and-down line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the axis . The axes are two number lines that create a grid on the coordinate plane. (Note: Axis is singular and axes is plural.)   Example of points in the coordinate plane.    Point A is at (2,3). Point B is at (-3,1). Point C is at (-1,-1). Point D is at (-1,3). Point E is at (0,1). Point F is at (4,0). Point G is at (0,-3). Point H is at (2,1). Point I is at (-1,1). Point J is at (-4,0).   10 points in the coordinate plane     The point at which the two axes intersect is called the origin . This point represents 0 for both axes, and is given the coordinates (aka ordered pair ) . Each point in the plane has coordinates (horizontal value, vertical value). For example, the point has the coordinates , the point has the coordinates , and the point has coordinates .  Write the coordinates of the rest of the points in this graph.         We will often be interested in graphs of lines and curves, rather than graphs of invidual points. Here is a graph that we will see again soon.   Team A    Parabola facing down. Increases from to about , then decreases to . The horizontal axis is labeled seconds and the vertical axis is labeled meters.   Parabola facing down. Increases from (0,0) to about (8,27), then decreases to (10,25).     This graph shows Team A's location from the starting line at every time during a race. From the axis labels, we can tell that the vertical axis tells us their location in meters and the horizontal axis tells us the time in seconds since the race began. Common types of questions to ask about this sort of graph include:   Where was Team A 10 sec into the race?   Solution: Since seconds are on the horizontal axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose horizontal coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the horizontal axis and look directly above and below until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the vertical coordinate of that point. In this case, our answer is 25 m.    How long did it take Team A to go 10 m?   Solution: Since distance in meters is on the vertical axis, we need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve whose vertical coordinate is 10. To do this, we go to 10 on the vertical axis and look directly to the right and left until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the horizontal coordinate of that point. In this case, we see that our point is between 1 and 2 on the horizontal axis. It's a little closer to 2 than to 1, we estimate that our answer is 1.6 sec. When we estimate, there's a range of acceptable answers. In this case, any number between 1.5 and 1.9 is a reasonable estimate.        Where was Team A after 5 seconds?      How long did it take Team A to go 20 m?         You will also need to know how to find average speed. Average speed is . For example, if I drove 100 miles in 2 hours, then my average speed was . Another example is that if after 2 hours, I was 100 mi from home and after 5 hours, I was 210 miles from home, then my average speed between hour 2 and hour 5 was      What was Team A's average speed between 5 and 10 seconds into the race?      What was Team A's average speed between 1.6 and 3.9 seconds into the race?      You'll need to be able to do the following things for this lesson. Rate how confident you are on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 = not confident and 5 = very confident).

To do this, we go to 10 on the vertical axis and look directly to the right and left until we find the curve. On this graph, we find point . Now that we've found the point we want, our answer is the horizontal coordinate of that point. In this case, we see that our point is between 1 and 2 on the horizontal axis. It's a little closer to 2 than to 1, we estimate that our answer is 1.6 sec. When we estimate, there's a range of acceptable answers. In this case, any number between 1.5 and 1.9 is a reasonable estimate.        Where was Team A after 5 seconds?      How long did it take Team A to go 20 m?    "

Suppose a family makes a quarterly (3-month) budget to plan for upcoming expenses. This family estimates they will use an average of 1000 kWh per month in July, August and September. How much money must the family set aside in the budget so that they will be able to pay for the electricity they will use during the three-month period? Round to the nearest dollar, since budgets are only estimates.         A local coffee shop offers a coffee card that you can preload with any amount of money and use like a debit card each day to purchase coffee.

Data plans for cell phone plans can be purchased in two different ways. One is an unlimited data plan where the customer pays a set monthly fee for unlimited data. The other is a per-gigabyte (GB) pricing service where the customer pays a set monthly fee plus a specified amount for each GB. The GBs are not prorated (that means it doesn't matter if the customer uses 0.001 GB or 1 GB, they must still pay for the entire 1 GB). The cost of the phone itself and other fees are the same amount under each plan.  Ximena is shopping for a data plan and needs to decide which option costs less.

These activities will introduce the idea of linear trends, which we'll spend more time in class. They'll also provide practice with building a linear model by identifying its slope and vertical intercept.     Several years ago, Onondaga Community College, in upstate New York, introduced a meal plan that included Flex Dollars that were stored on students' ID cards. Each student was given $150 Flex Dollars as part of their meal plan package that could be used like cash at several campus dining locations.

Smartphones, like many other manufactured goods, depreciate on a daily basis. Depreciation means how much an item (e.g. a smartphone) loses in value compared to the price that was originally paid for it from the manufacturer. There tends to be two main periods in a smartphone's life when it sees the biggest drops in value: 1. the period of time after the phone is initially purchased, and 2. when the manufacturer launches a new model.  In September 2019, the iPhone 11 256GB was released with a price of $849. Twelve months after the launch, it was found that the value of iPhone 11s depreciated about 37% (which is actually better than most smartphone depreciation!).   Suppose Coraline bought a new iPhone 11 256GB in September 2019 for $849. The phone would soon start depreciating in value. The following table shows the approximate value of her iPhone 11, by month from September 2019.

In 2013 it was about $25,000. In 2014 it was about $27,000. In 2015 it was about $27,500. In 2016 it was about $28,500. In 2017 it was about $28,500. In 2018 it was about $29,000. In 2019 it as about $30,000. In 2020 it was about $31,000. In 2021 it was about $31,500. In 2022 it was $32,000.   Graph showing annual pay in each year between 2012 and 2022.        Find a linear equation that approximately models the above situation. Use to represent Nelson's pay in dollars and to represent the number of years since 2012.      If the trend continues, in what year would he expect to earn $36,000 a year?      Nelson is using extrapoloation to predict his future salary, so his prediction is unlikely to be perfect and could even be quite a bit off. Extrapolation is the process of using a mathematical model to make predictions that are outside the range of the available data, based on the assumption that existing trends will continue. The problem with extrapolation is that the trend could change in the future, for any number of reasons, which would make the prediction unreliable. Give at least one example of way that the trend in Nelson's salary might change and result his prediction being very wrong.         The following table shows the average weight for infant boys:    Average Weight of Boys, Ages 10 - 20 months    Age (months)  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20    Weight (kg)  9.2  9.4  9.7  9.9  10.1  10.3  10.5  10.7  10.9  11.1  11.4        Explain why a linear model could be created and used to fairly accurately calculate the average weight of an infant boy, given his age in months.      Create a linear model for the weight of infant boys.      Use your model to predict the weight of a 14.5-month-old boy. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.      Use your model to predict the weight of a 2-year-old boy. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.      Use your model to predict the weight of a 25-year-old man. Is your prediction reasonable? Explain.     Every year, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project releases an analysis of land-surface temperature records (some going back as far as 250 years). According to Berkeley Earth, The analysis shows that the rise [or growth] in average world land temperature[is]... about 1.3 degrees Celsius. BEST states that global warming is real, and attributes the temperature trend to a combination of volcanoes and CO 2 .  There are others who are skeptical of the theory of global warming and hold a contrary view of weather data. These people believe that there are other explanations and reasons for the climate changes being experienced. In the next two activities, we are going to examine the Berkeley Earth project data and linear models for Global Surface Temperature Change to study the issue of global warming.  On the website , the data from the Berkeley Earth project has been used as the source for two different analyses of the same information. The first one is labeled How Realists View Global Warming > and the other is How Contrarians View Global Warming. The two infographics are reproduced here. You will see that each includes a line or line segments along with the actual data. Use these infographics to answer the following questions.      Below is an infographic showing the data gathered by BEST showing the monthly Global Temperature Anomaly (that is, the change in average Global Temperature, in degrees Celsius) for the years 1970-2022. It is stated on the project's website that the baseline period is the 1850-1900 mean. This means that the data from 1970-2022 is compared with the data from 1850-1900.   Difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a trendline. Image from Quantway College Module M.3 by Carnegie Math Pathways   Graph showing the difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a trendline.   The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. Exact points on the trend line are hard to estimate, but it appears that (1970, 0.21) and (2022, 1.28) are both approximately on the line.     Shown on the graph is a trendline, also known as a line of best fit, that is a linear model representing the trend of the data.     What are the units on the horizontal axis? What is the variable?      What are the units on the vertical axis? What is the variable?      What does one point on the graph represent?      Now look at the trendline that is drawn on the graph. What does this line represent?      Do you think the trendline is reasonable? Does it represent the trends in the data?      Estimate the value where the trendline crosses the vertical axis (we will treat this as the value in 1970). Describe the meaning of the point where the trendline crosses the vertical axis.      Estimate the slope of this line in degrees Celsius per year (although the original data is monthly, the slope will be per year). Write an interpretation of the slope in this context. Be sure to use units with your values, and use complete sentences. Finding exact points on this line is difficult. Just do your best to estimate two points and use them to find the slope.      Using your own estimates, estimate the equation of the line.      What is the model saying about the general pattern of the global temperature. Is it rising or falling?      Using your linear equation from above, predict the temperature change at the end of 2030. Also predict the temperature change at the end of 2050. Do you think this is a reliable prediction for 2050? Why or why not? Explain using complete sentences.         The infographic below contains the same data points for the Global Temperature Change (the change in average Global Temperature in the years from 1970-2022) that were included in the infographic showing How Realists View Global Warming. This infographic is meant to depict a common view stated by contrarians that global warming is not real since there have been several periods over the last 50 years when global temperatures have declined on average.   Difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a piecewise model. Image from Quantway College Module M.3 by Carnegie Math Pathways   Graph showing the difference in average global temperature from the 1850-1900 mean with a piecewise model.   The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. There are seven short-term trendlines shown, each of which is either decreasing or roughly horizontal. The trend line from 2010 to 2015 starts at about (2010, 1.1) and ends at about (2015, 0.9).     Also shown is a piecewise model, which is a model defined by multiple pieces, each of which has its own trendline that represents the trend of the data within a certain interval. This infographic shows a linear piecewise model that consists of 7 line segments - each of which can be considered a trendline for that restricted time period.     Look at the line segments that are drawn on the graph. What do these lines represent as a whole?      Now look at just the segment of the piecewise best fit model from 2010 to 2015 (the line segment second farthest to the right). Estimate where the line segment would cross the vertical axis (in year 1970). (Hint: It might be useful to use a straight-edged item to extend the line to the vertical axis. You can see the line is very slightly slanted.)      What is the slope value of the 2010 to 2015 line segment? Give an interpretation of the slope value.      Estimate the equation of the 2010 to 2015 line segment.      Could we use the equation of the 2010 to 2015 line segment to predict the mean Global Surface Temperature Change in 2035? Why or why not?      Explain what the Contrarian Model is saying about the general pattern of global temperature. Is it rising or falling? Think about this on your own for a minute before sharing your ideas in your group.      If you look at the overall trend of the data in the infographic, it is increasing. However, each line segment in the piecewise model is decreasing (ever so slightly). What does this mean? Explain what the model is saying about the general pattern of global temperature change.      Come up with an example of a similar piecewise linear model. Note that models can be represented in different ways - tables, graphs, written descriptions, or equations. We will explore piecewise models in the next lesson.      "

We knew that the rates for this plan are .

Now, let's consider the cost of electricity in and around Denver in the winter. Use the information given in the table above to build a linear model for the bill amount, , of a customer that uses kWh in the winter.      The company that provides electricity to people in and around New Orleans, Louisiana is called Entergy. The table below estimates the winter monthly rates charged by Entergy .

Build a linear model for the bill , of a customer that used 800 kWh or less.      Build a linear model for the bill , of a customer that used more than 800 kWh.          The situation in is called piecewise defined or a piecewise linear model. It is piecewise because the cost changes based on the amount of electricity used. Cost per kWh is not constant, so the graph of this situation is not a line. But it is piecewise linear, because cost per kWh is constant on each piece.  We found that when the number of kilowatt hours used, is 800 or less, the bill is . When the number of kilowatt hours used is more than 800, , or . Mathematicians like to put both of these equations together like this: The { symbol is there to tell you that this is a piecewise formula. The at the end of the first line tells you to use that part of the formula when is 800 or less. The at the end of the second line tells you to use that part of the formula when is bigger than 800.     Use the piecewise formula to find the bill for customers who used 600 kWh, 900 kWh, and 1200 kWh. You should get the same answers as you did in       Graph this piecewise linear model.

Julio is moving from one apartment to another apartment in a neighboring town. He needs to rent a truck for one day to move his belongings. Julio uses the Internet to search for companies with trucks for rent. He finds two companies that have trucks available on the day he needs one: Rent-A-Truk and Trucks-4-Less.  Rent-A-Truk advertises a rate of $40 for the day, plus 60 cents a mile for every mile over 40 miles.  Trucks-4-Less advertises a rate of $25 a day plus 80 cents a mile for every mile over 25 miles.       What factors will Julio use to determine which company to rent from?      Fill in the blank with little or no calculation: If Julio only drives _________ miles during the day, Trucks-4-Less will end up being the better deal. Explain your reasoning.      Fill in the blank with little or no calculation: If Julio drives _________ miles during the day, Rent-A-Truk will end up being the better deal. Explain your reasoning.      Without doing any calculations, do you know if there will ever be a time when the two rental plans would cost the same?      How much total mileage used will make the cost of both rental plans about the same? Use any method you wish to make this approximation.      Set up an algebraic model that can be used to represent the cost for using Rent-A-Truk, given that one plans on driving miles.      If a person plans on driving miles, what would the algebraic model be to represent the cost for using Trucks-4-Less, ?      Julio might want to know at what mileage the cost of the Rent-A-Truk plan equals the cost of the Trucks-4-Less plan.

  "body": " Building Exponential Models Activities     We have seen that when a quantity increases or decreases by the same amount for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as a linear model. That is, linear models have a constant average rate of change. For example, think of getting a $500 raise every year; in this case, the average rate of change is $500\/year.  When a quantity increases or decreases by the same percentage for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as an exponential model . Exponential models have a constant percent change and a constant change factor. For example, think of getting a 3% raise every year; in this case, the constant change factor is 1.03.

Your answer to the previous question is the formula for an exponential model for the Indiana town's population! Find a formula for an exponential model for the Ohio town's population.      Write a formula showing how to build an exponential using the change factor and the initial value.          Suppose that the cost of attending a certain four-year private college (tuition and fees) was $16,500 in 1977 and that the cost increased about 3.2% every year.     Create a formula for an exponential model that could be used to estimate the cost of attending this college over time.      According to your model, what would be the tuition and fees for 1987, 1997, and 2022? Round your answers to the nearest dollar.      How many years from 1977 did it take for the total cost of tuition and fees to double? To triple?      If the original cost of attending the college in 1977 was only $12,000, how would the doubling and tripling time change?      Explain one strategy you could use to determine the year when this model would predict a cost of $42,000. Assume we are using the original cost of $16,500 for 1977.         The rate of elimination of caffeine from the human body varies greatly from individual to individual. Suppose that Jacob drinks a 16-ounce coffee drink that contains about 310 mg of caffeine. His body eliminates about 13% of the caffeine every hour. Hint: Assume all caffeine is absorbed into the body as soon as the coffee is drunk.     Create a formula for an exponential model for this situation. Let be the number of hours after drinking a 16-oz cup of coffee, and let be the amount of caffeine in your body.      How much caffeine would be in Jacob's body right after he drank a second 16-ounce coffee drink, exactly three hours after drinking the first one?      Approximately how long will it take for Jacob's body to eliminate half of the caffeine from one 16-ounce coffee drink?     Try to use algebra to answer this question! What happens?      Use a graphing utility to create a precise graphical model of the amount of caffeine in Jacob's body from one 16-ounce coffee drink. Use your graph to answer the question. Include a sketch of your graph and the steps you used to find the answer here.       If Jacob drank a 12-ounce Pepsi containing 38 mg of caffeine instead of the coffee drink, how long will it take for Jacob's body to eliminate half of the caffeine? Write your answer rounded to the nearest whole hour.         For each scenario below, find an algebraic formula to model the scenario and then use Desmos or another graphing device to create a graph. Use your formula and\/or a graph to answer the question about the scenario.     Shawn's brand new Dodge Charger valued at $52,445 depreciates at the rate of 8% per year. He plans to sell it in 5 years. How much will it be worth then?      Fletcher currently exercises for about an hour per week. They'd like to exercise for the recommended 150 minutes per week. They know that they're more likely to sustain the change if they slowly increase the amount they're exercising each week instead of trying to jump from one hour to 150 minutes. If Fletcher increases how much they exercise by 20 minutes each week, how many weeks will it take them to get to their goal of 150 minutes per week?      Melany's starting salary is $55,000, and she will be getting a 2% pay raise every year. How many years will it take for her salary to be $60,000?      Joan quit her job at GM when she was 35 years old. Her friend, who is a financial advisor, recommended that she leave her 401(k) retirement savings in GM's retirement plan rather than withdrawing or transferring the money to a new plan. Her friend said that, on average, Joan could expect a 6% increase per year if she left her money in the plan for many years, based on the past performance of GM's plan. Joan will not be able to add more money to the GM 401(k) account, but can open a new one at her new job. How long will it take for the amount of money Joan has in the GM 401(k) to double?         The half-life of a substance with an exponential model is the amount of time it takes for half of the substance to be eliminated. For example, the half-life of a drug in the blood in the amount of time it takes for half of the drug to be elminiated from the body, and the half-life of a radioactive element is the amount of time it takes for half of the starting amount to decay.     If the half-life of a certain drug is 3 hours, and 25 mg of the drug is in the blood at 5 pm, how much of the drug will be in the blood at 8 pm? How long will it take for there to be 6.25 mg of the drug left in the blood?      Earlier, we assumed that the body could eliminate 13% of the caffeine present every hour. Wikipedia states that the half-life of caffeine in a healthy adult is often between 4.9 and 6 hours. If 13% of the caffeine is eliminated every hour, does this imply a half-life between 4.9 and 6 hours? Explain.      The antibiotic tetracycline is used for treatment against many different bacterial infections. Suppose that an individual is given 300 mg of tetracycline per dose, and the half-life of tetracycline is 8 hours. Assume all tetracycline is absorbed into the body immediately.     Use that the half-life of tetracycline is 8 hours to fill in the table below.   Amount of Tetracycline in the Body    Hours Since Dose  Number of 8 Hours Periods,  Amount of Tetracycline (mg),    0  0  300    8  1     16      24      48           Find an algebraic formula for , the amount of tetracycline in the body, after 8-hour periods.      It would be more convenient to have a formula for , the amount of tetracycline in the body, after hours! If it has been hours, how many 8-hour periods has it been? Use your observation to rewrite your formula for in terms of instead of .      Suppose that Reese is given a 300-mg tetracycline does every 6-hrs. How much tetracycline does he have left in his body just before his second dose?       "

  "body": " The Log Operation Activities    We use opposite operations to solve equations. If you can see what operations are currently applied to a variable, you can do the opposite operations to solve the equation - to find out what number the variable stands for. Some examples of operations in math are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising a number to a power, and taking a root of a number (such as the square root).  Fill in the column on the right in the table below:      If you have an equation like...  ...you can solve it by using the opposite operation.  Write the operation you would use to solve the equation, and then solve it.                              Now, consider the following example. Even though both equations include the same numbers and the same variable, they are fundamentally different. It's all about the placement of a variable.   The equation on the left is a cubic equation; the variable is in the base of .  The equation on the right is an exponential equation; the variable is in the exponent of    Variable as Base vs. Variable as Exponent    Given equation      Given operation  The variable is cubed.  is raised to the power of     An equation that has a variable in the exponent is called an exponential equation. Sometimes, we can solve such equations by inspection . This means we look at an equation and see what number could go in place of the variable to make the equation true, such as in the equation ,where we know that because .   Note: If a problem asks you to solve an equation by inspection, but you don't have that arithmetic fact memorized and don't see the answer, that's okay! In that case, use the instruction to solve by inspection as a hint that the answer is probably a small nice number, and solve by guess and check instead.    Solve the equations below by inspection.                      In , we saw that we can also undo the operation in an exponential equation using logarithms, which are often referred to as logs. We learned to use the log operation to solve equations when the base is the number 10 (such as ).  Solve the equations below. Think about the operation you would use to solve the equation first and then solve it. Round to the nearest thousandth.                  What if the base isn't 10? For example, consider the examples You might be able to use inspection to see that the solution to is because you remember that , but the answers to the other two examples are not nice numbers. To solve this problem, we have to tell our calculator to use a base other than 10 for our log. We write for the log base operation. The log base operation finds the exponent of that gives us the number we're looking for. For example,   The expression is equal to , since .  The expression is equal to , since .  The expression is equal to , since .   The log base operation let us solve and :  The solution to is  The solution to is  But what numbers are and ? Many calculators can only evaluate logs with base 10 or the special number . To evaluate something like using log base 10 instead of log base 3, we use that Since , it seems like we probably got the right answer, since that tiny a difference is probably just rounding.       The solution to is . Turn this into a decimal using log base 10 and a calculator, then check your answer.        Solve each of the equations below. Write your answer in two ways: as and as a decimal, rounded to the nearest thousandth. Double check your answers!                           We looked at the following scenario in :   Suppose that the cost of attending a certain four-year private college (tuition and fees) was $16,500 in 1977 and that the cost increased about 3.2% every year.   We found that is a formula that models this situation where is tuition and is years since 1977. We then thought about how we might determine the year when tuition would reach $42,000. We considered various methods, such as guess-and-check (guessing different values and checking the results), to find a solution to the equation: .     In what year is tuition predicted to be $42,000? Use an algebraic strategy to find the answer.      What method could you use to determine whether your solution is correct? Explain your method, then use it to check your answer.         We also modeled the amount of caffeine Jacob has left in his body several hours after drinking a 16-oz coffee drink in . Suppose that Jacob has just consumed a 16-ounce cup of coffee containing 300 mg of caffeine.     If caffeine is being eliminated from Jacob's body at a rate of 13% every hour, how long before three quarters of the caffeine has been eliminated? Enter your answer rounded to the nearest hour. ( Hint: First, set up a model for the situation and then use it to answer the question.)      How much caffeine will be in Jason’s blood if he drinks another 16-ounce cup of coffee 5 hours after the first?      Exponential equations are often seen when working with accounts or loans that use compound interest. Compound interest occurs when interest is calculated on both the initial principal and any accumulated interest from previous periods. (Note: For comparison, recall that simple interest does not take into account the accumulated interest, that is, the interest each year is only based on the initial principal.) The equation for computing the amount of a loan, or in an account, that uses compound interest (assuming no change in principal) is where  represents the total amount of the loan or in the account.  represents the principal (initial amount of the loan or money put into the account).  represents the interest rate, written as a decimal.  represents the number of compounding periods per year.  represents the term of the loan in years or time since opening the account in years.    Suppose that you take out a $2000 loan with a compound interest rate of 4%, compounded annually (once a year). If you make no payments, and interest compounds annually, in how many years will the loan balance double (reach or surpass $4000)? Think about this on your own for a minute before sharing your ideas in your group.      A log is an operation that combines two numbers to make a new number. The log operation combines the base and a target, and gives us back the exponent that we need to raise the base to to get the target. Just like when you learned the raise to the power of operation in a previous math class, practice is the key to feeling comfortable with this new operation.      Let's pratice using the relationship between logs and exponents to rewrite equations. The key idea to use is that   The equation is equivalent to the equation .   Rewrite each of the log equations as exponential equations, and each of the exponetial equations as log equations.                                  In real applications, we nearly always use a calculator to evaluate logs. But, evaluating logs without a calculator is a useful practice drill when we're first learning logs. This is uncomfortable at first, but it makes our brains think about what a log means and helps us to feel more comfortable using logs in the future. Don't use a calculator for this activity , except to check your answer! The purpose of this activity isn't to get the answers, but to practice thinking about how the log operation works.  Evaluate each of the log operations below.                                  Milo's homework includes the problem , and he keeps getting it wrong.

We also saw that we can use the log base operation to undo the raise to the power of operation. This has allowed us to solve exponential equations algebraically.  A logarithmic equation , or a log equation, is an equation that has the variable inside of a log. We will need to solve log equations in the next lesson. In order to solve log equations, we need to know how to undo the log operation. Fortunately, we don't need another new operation! The raise to the power of operation undoes the log base operation. For our purposes, it will be sufficient to use the raise 10 to the power of operation to undo the log (assumed baes 10) operation. That is, we will use the fact to undo the log operation. This fact is true because is the number so that   As an example, let's solve the log equation . Applying the raise 10 to the power of operation to both sides gives us . Since , we can rewrite as . Using a calculator to find , we get that . We can check this is correct by using a calculator and finding . That's is close enough to that we can be confident the difference is just from rounding.  Use the raise 10 to the power of operation to undo the logs and solve each of the log equations below.

In order to solve log equations, we need to know how to undo the log operation. Fortunately, we don't need another new operation! The raise to the power of operation undoes the log base operation.

The same thing is true of exponential models! Today, we will put the skills we've been learning together to analyze data sets with exponential trends.  A consequence of the relationship between and raising to powers is that if we have data with an exponential trend and take the log of one of the variables, we get a new data set with a linear trend. Linear trends are easier to work with than exponential trends, so scientists use this trick to help them study data with an exponential trend.

Pink noise is a type of sound that may help some people fall asleep and\/or help people with ADHD concentrate. C. Johnson, Have you tried pink noise for sleep? Here's what to know. AP New, May 20, 2024. Higher frequency sounds are less intense than low frequency sounds in pink noise. We can model this relationship using the formula where is the power of the sound and is its frequency.     The two octaves around middle A on a piano have frequencies of about 220 - 880 Hz. Sketch a graph showing the relationship of power to frequency in pink noise for the two octaves around middle A. Hint: You don't need to know anything about music to solve this problem. The instructions are telling you that the horizontal axis should start at 220 and go up to 880. Choose some numbers between 220 and 880, plug them into the formula to find the power, and then use these points to make a graph.      The model for pink noise is also a power model! We can rewrite it as . Talk to your table and brainstorm reasons why it might make sense for negative exponents to be related to variables in the denominator of fractions.
