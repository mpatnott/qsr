<div class="introduction"><div class="para">Edna makes ceramic gnomes to sell at a local craft market each week. The cost of her ceramic-making equipment is $100 and the cost of supplies per gnome is $15. If the selling price per gnome is $50 then Edna will sell 28 gnomes per week but if she drops the price to $45 per gnome then she will sell 32 of them per week.</div></div>

<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">price-demand function</dfn> is a mathematical model the describes the relationship between the selling price of an item and the demand, i.e., the number of items sold.

<div class="para">The model <span class="process-math">\(R = xp\)</span> is a multivariable model for revenue. It’s often useful to turn multivariable models into single variable models, when possible, because many of the mathematical tools we use to analyze models are simpler when there are fewer variables. We can get a model for revenue that includes only <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> (the number of items sold) by replacing <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> with the price-demand function.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For example, Manuel sells handmade cutting boards at the craft fair. His price-demand function for his cutting boards is</div>
