<div class="introduction"><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">One measure that analysts use to determine the strength of the Social Security Trust Fund finances is the “Trust Fund Ratio”.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Trust Fund Ratio} = \frac{\text{Trust fund asset reserves at beginning of year}}{\text{Total cost of running Social Security for that year}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">For example, in 2010 the asset reserves of the Social Security trust fund were $2.5 trillion and the total cost of the program that year was $706.3 billion, so the Trust Fund Ratio was 354%. Another way of saying this is that the trust fund asset reserves were 3.54 times greater than the cost of the program. The Trust Fund Ratio indicates how much of recipients’ annual benefit amounts could be paid from the balance at the beginning of a given year. When the Trust Fund Ratio drops below 100%, then this means that the fund is unable to pay out the total benefits due.</div>
</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<div class="para">From 2010 to 2019, the Trust Fund Ratio declined 7.7 percentage points each year. The Trust Fund Ratio in 2010 was 354%. Using 354 as the starting amount, create a linear model and determine in what year the model predicts the Trust Fund Ratio to fall below 100. Your model can be a table, a graph, or an equation.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Use the Trust Fund Ratio information for 2020 and 2022 in the table below to create a linear model and determine in what year the model predicts the Trust Fund Ratio to fall below 100.
