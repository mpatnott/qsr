                    The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) is an independent, nonprofit scientific and educational organization dedicated to reducing deaths, injuries and property damage from motor vehicle crashes. In 2021, the IIHS published statistics showing, in part, that almost three out of four motor vehicle crash deaths were males.<fn><url href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females" /></fn>
