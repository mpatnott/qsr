        <introduction>
            <p>
                In the real world, we often describe increases and decreases in terms of percentages. For example, sales tax and tips are often calculated as a percent increase, and discounts are often calculated as a percent decrease. In previous classes, you likely calculated the new total by first finding the amount of the increase or decrease, and then adding or subtracting. In this class, we will find it useful to use a different strategy: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If there's a <m>p\%</m> increase, then the new total is <m>(100 + p)\%</m> of the original. If there's a <m>p\%</m> decrease, then the new total is <m>(100 - p)\%</m> of the original.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <alert>Example (increase):</alert> If we add a <m>20\%</m> tip, then the total is <m>120\%</m> of the original bill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <alert>Example (decrease):</alert> If an item is <m>20\%</m> off, then its new price is <m>80\%</m> of its original price.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Find the new total from the original using the percent you found in Step 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <alert>Example (increase):</alert> If we add a <m>20\%</m> tip, then the total is <m>120\%</m> of the original bill. So, if the bill was originally <m>\$40</m>, the bill with tip is <me>40 \times \frac{120}{100} = \$48</me>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <alert>Example (decrease):</alert> If an item is <m>20\%</m> off, then its new price is <m>80\%</m> of its original price. So, if the item originally cost <m>\$40</m>, then its sales price is <me>40 \times \frac{80}{100} = \$32</me>.
