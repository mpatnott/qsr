            Recall from <xref ref="sec-power-models-prep"/> that a <term>power model</term> is a relationship between two quantities that can be written in the form <me>Q_2 = c \times Q_1^p</me>, where <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_2</m> are the two quantities, <m>c</m> is a number called the <term>coefficient</term> and <m>p</m> is a number called the <term>power</term>.

    <!-- Power models are often expressed in words using the language of proportionality. For example:
\begin{itemize}
%	\item Words: The strength of a beam, $S$, is proportional to the square of its thickness, $h$ \\
%		  Power Model: $S = ch^2$, with $c$ an unknown number

	\item Words: The energy, $E$, expended by a swimming dolphin is proportional to the cube of the speed, $v$ of the dolphin \\
	      Power Model: $E = cv^3$, with $c$ an unknown number
	
	\item Words: The braking distance, $d$, of an Alfa Romeo on dry pavement is proportional to the square of its speed ($v$), with constant of proportionality $0.036$ \\
		  Power Model Formula: $d = 0.036v^2$

            When an aircraft takes off, it accelerates until it reaches its takeoff speed <m>V</m>. In doing so it uses up a distance <m>R</m> of the runway, where <m>R</m> is proportional to the square of the takeoff speed. If <m>V</m> is measured in mph and <m>R</m> is measured in feet, then the constant of proportionality is <m>0.1639</m>.

Flights to Foula serve tourists and deliver essential items to island's handful of residents.
