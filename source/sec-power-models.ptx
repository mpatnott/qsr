    <introduction>
        <p>
            Power models with positive powers are often expressed in words using the language of <term>proportionality</term>, or by saying that one quantity <term>varies directly</term> with another. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Words: The strength of a beam, <m>S</m>, is proportional to the square of its thickness, <m>h</m> <br />
        		        Power Model: <m>S = ch^2</m>, with <m>c</m> an unknown number

                    <p>
                        Words: The energy, <m>E</m>, expended by a swimming dolphin varies directly with the cube of its speed, <m>v</m><br />
                        Power Model: <m>E = cv^3</m>, with <m>c</m> an unknown number

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Words: The braking distance, <m>d</m>, of an Alfa Romeo on dry pavement is proportional to the square of its speed (<m>v</m>), with coefficient <m>0.036</m> <br />
                        Power Model Formula: <m>d = 0.036v^2</m>

            When an aircraft takes off, it accelerates until it reaches its takeoff speed <m>V</m>.

An aircraft with a takeoff speed of 100 mph needs 1639 feet of runway. <!-- If <m>V</m> is measured in mph and <m>R</m> is measured in feet, then the constant of proportionality is <m>0.1639</m>.-->
