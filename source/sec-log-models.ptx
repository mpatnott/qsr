                We use "opposite" operations to solve equations. If you can see what operations are currently applied to a variable, you can do the opposite operations to solve the equation - to find out what number the variable stands for. Some examples of operations in math are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising a number to a power, and taking a root of a number (such as the square root).

        An equation that has a variable in the exponent is called an <term>exponential equation.</term> Sometimes, we can solve such equations by <term>inspection</term>. This means we look at an equation and see what number could go in place of the variable to make the equation true, such as in the equation <m>10^x=100</m>,where we know that <m>x = 2</m> because <m>10^2= 100</m>. <em>Note:</em> If a problem asks you to solve an equation by inspection, but you don't have that arithmetic fact memorized and don't see the answer, that's okay! In that case, use the instruction to "solve by inspection" as a hint that the answer is probably a small nice number, and solve by guess and check instead.

            <p>
                In <xref ref="sec-log-models-prep"/>, we saw that we can also undo the operation in an exponential equation using logarithms, which are often referred to as logs. We learned to use the log operation to solve equations when the base is the number 10 (such as <m>10^x=16</m>).

            <statement>

        What if the base isn't 10? For example, consider the examples
        <me>3^x = 25 \qquad 7^x = 49 \qquad 1.05^x = 1.6</me>
        You might be able to use inspection to see that the solution to <m>7^x = 49</m> is <m>x = 2</m> because you remember that <m>7^2=49</m>, but the answers to the other two examples are not nice numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to solve this problem:
        <ol>
            <li><p> We said in <xref ref="sec-log-models-prep"/> that the log button on our calculators assumes the base is 10 <em>unless we tell it otherwise</em>. On some calculators, we can specificy the base we want to use for our log. In general, we write <me>\log_b(x)</me> for the number that we need to raise <m>b</m> to in order to get out <m>x</m> as our answer. For example,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The expression <m>\log_7(49)</m> is equal to <m>2</m>, since <m>7^2 = 49</m>.</li>
                    <li>The expression <m>\log_2(16)</m> is equal to <m>4</m>, since <m>2^4 = 16</m>.</li>
                    <li>The expression <m>\log_b\left(b^x\right)</m> is equal to <m>x</m>, since <m>b^x = b^x</m>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some calculators can only compute logs with a base of 10 and the special number <m>e</m>. On these calculators, we use the formula <me>\text{If } b^x = a \text{, then } x = \frac{\log a}{\log b}</me>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Exponential equations are often seen when working with accounts or loans that use compound interest. Compound interest occurs when interest is calculated on both the initial principal and any accumulated interest from previous periods. (Note: For comparison, recall that simple interest does not take into account the accumulated interest, that is, the interest each year is only based on the initial principal.) The equation for computing the amount of a loan, or in an account, that uses compound interest (assuming no change in principal) is
            <me>A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}</me>
            where
            <ul>
                <li><m>A</m> represents the total amount of the loan or in the account.</li>
                <li><m>P</m> represents the principal (initial amount of the loan or money put into the account).</li>
                <li><m>r</m> represents the interest rate, written as a decimal.</li>
                <li><m>n</m> represents the number of compounding periods per year.</li>
                <li><m>t</m> represents the term of the loan in years or time since opening the account in years.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        Suppose that you take out a $2000 loan with a compound interest rate of 4%, compounded annually (once a year). If you make no payments, and interest compounds annually, in how many years will the loan balance double (reach or surpass $4000)? Think about this on your own for a minute before sharing your ideas in your group.
