                We use "opposite" operations to solve equations. If you can see what operations are currently applied to a variable, you can do the opposite operations to solve the equation - to find out what number the variable stands for. Some examples of operations in math are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising a number to a power, and taking a root of a number (such as the square root).

        Now, consider the following example. Even though both equations include the same numbers and the same variable, they are fundamentally different. It's all about the placement of a variable.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The equation on the left is a cubic equation; the variable <m>x</m> is in the base of <m>x^3</m>.</li>
        <li>The equation on the right is an exponential equation; the variable <m>x</m> is in the exponent of <m>3^x</m></li>
    </ul>

        <title>Variable as Base vs. Variable as Exponent</title>
        <tabular>
            <row>
                <cell>Given equation</cell>
                <cell><m>x^3 = 25</m></cell>
                <cell><m>3^x = 25</m></cell>

            <row>
                <cell>Given operation</cell>
                <cell>The variable <m>x</m> is cubed.</cell>
                <cell><m>3</m> is raised to the power of <m>x</m></cell>

        An equation that has a variable in the exponent is called an <term>exponential equation.</term> Sometimes, we can solve such equations by <term>inspection</term>. This means we look at an equation and see what number could go in place of the variable to make the equation true, such as in the equation <m>10^x=100</m>,where we know that <m>x = 2</m> because <m>10^2= 100</m>. <em>Note:</em> If a problem asks you to solve an equation by inspection, but you don't have that arithmetic fact memorized and don't see the answer, that's okay! In that case, use the instruction to "solve by inspection" as a hint that the answer is probably a small nice number, and solve by guess and check instead.
