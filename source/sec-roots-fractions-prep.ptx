  <title>Roots and Fractional Powers Prep Activities</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        We learned in <xref ref="sec-power-models"/> that cube roots and the one-third power are the same, i.e., that <m>\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}</m>. In fact, this is a special case of the general rule that nth roots and the 1/n power are the same, i.e., <me>\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{1/n}</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <alert>Note:</alert> We use square roots so often that we don't usually bother to write the number on the root. But, <m>\sqrt{x} = \sqrt[2]{x}</m>, so <m>\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}</m>. 
    </p>

  <investigation xml:id="pa-why-frac-exps-are-roots">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Using the Product Rule for Exponents,
            <me>x^{1/2}x^{1/2} = x^1 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad x^{1/3}x^{1/3}x^{1/3} = x^1</me>.
            Why does this observation support the reasonableness of the rules that <m>x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x}</m> and <m>x^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{x}</m>?

            Let's practice using our new rule, along with other exponent rules, to rewrite expressions. Remember, if you're not sure what to do, look for an opportunity to use any one of the exponent rules, use it, and then re-evaluate.

    <introduction>
        <p>
            We introduced the one-third power in <xref ref="sec-power-models"/> to help us solve the equation <me>10 = x^3</me>. Notice that the Power Rule for Exponents tells us that
            <me>\left(x^n\right)^{1/n} = x \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \left(x^{1/n}\right)^n = x</me>.
            That is, the nth power and the 1/n power undo each other. Use this fact to find all solutions to each of the equations below.
