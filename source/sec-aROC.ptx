                    In a three-legged race, people compete in teams of two. In each team, one person's left leg is tied to the other persons right leg. All teams then run from the start to the finish, competing to be the first team across the finish line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graphs below show three teams' progress in a three-legged race at summer camp. The finish line for this race was 25 meters from the starting line.
