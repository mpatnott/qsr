            Pink noise is a type of sound that may help some people fall asleep and/or help people with ADHD concentrate.<fn>C. Johnson, <q>Have you tried pink noise for sleep? Here's what to know.</q> AP New, May 20, 2024. <url href="https://apnews.com/article/pink-brown-white-noise-sleep-focus-concentration-f5f24dad1effb09c1cf8b607bd22ebc7"></url></fn> Higher frequency sounds are less intense than low frequency sounds in pink noise. We can model this relationship using the formula <me>P = \frac{1}{f}</me> where <m>P</m> is the power of the sound and <m>f</m> is its frequency.

                The two octaves around middle A on a piano have frequencies of about 220 - 880 Hz. Sketch a graph showing the relationship of power to frequency in pink noise for the two octaves around middle A.

                The model for pink noise is also a power model! We can rewrite it as <me>P = f^{-1}</me>. Talk to your table and brainstorm reasons why it might make sense for negative exponents to be related to variables in the denominator of fractions.

                Brown noise is similar to pink noise, but has the model <me> P = \frac{1}{f^2} </me> instead. How can we rewrite this formula as a power model? Think on your own, and then compare notes with your table.

    Pressure is a measure of the amount of force spread over an area.
    <me>P = \frac{F}{A}</me>
    where
    <ul>
        <li><m>P</m> is pressure</li>
        <li><m>F</m> is the force in units of pounds (lbs) or Newtons (N),</li>
        <li><m>A</m> is the area in units of square inches, or meters, or similar.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Walking on snow (or mud) is difficult because our feet tend to puncture the snow (high pressure applied to low strength snow). We can use snowshoes to avoid this problem: they reduce pressure with minimal increase in force (weight).

    Determine the pressure Guido exerts on the snow without and with snow shoes. Suppose Guido weighs 172 lbs.
