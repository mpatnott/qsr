    <introduction>
        <p>
            Power models with negative powers are often expressed in words using the language of <term>inverse proportionality</term>, or by saying that one quantity <term>varies indirectly</term> with another. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The force <m>F</m> (in pounds) needed on a wrench handle to loosen a certain bolt varies inversely with the length <m>L</m> of the handle. So <me>F = \frac{c}{L} \qquad \text{or} \qquad F = cL^{-1}</me> for some constant <m>c</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The weight, <m>w</m>, of an object above the surface of Earth varies inversely with the square of distance from the center of Earth, <m>d</m>. So <me>w = \frac{c}{d^2} \qquad \text{or} \qquad w = cd^{-2}</me> for some constant <m>c</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In each of the following situations, set up the power model being described. Use the information given to find the coefficient, then answer the question.

                The loudness, <m>L</m>, of a sound (measured in decibels, dB) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, <m>d</m>, from the source of the sound. When a person 7.0 feet from a jetski, it is 75.0 decibels loud. How loud is the jetski when the person is 45 feet away?

            Pink noise is a type of sound that may help some people fall asleep and/or help people with ADHD concentrate.<fn>C. Johnson, <q>Have you tried pink noise for sleep? Here's what to know.</q> AP New, May 20, 2024. <url href="https://apnews.com/article/pink-brown-white-noise-sleep-focus-concentration-f5f24dad1effb09c1cf8b607bd22ebc7"></url></fn> Higher frequency sounds are less intense than low frequency sounds in pink noise. We can model this relationship using the formula <me>P = \frac{1}{f}</me> where <m>P</m> is the power of the sound and <m>f</m> is its frequency.

                The two octaves around middle A on a piano have frequencies of about 220 - 880 Hz. Sketch a graph showing the relationship of power to frequency in pink noise for the two octaves around middle A.

                The model for pink noise is also a power model! We can rewrite it as <me>P = f^{-1}</me>. Talk to your table and brainstorm reasons why it might make sense for negative exponents to be related to variables in the denominator of fractions.

                Brown noise is similar to pink noise, but has the model <me> P = \frac{1}{f^2} </me> instead. How can we rewrite this formula as a power model? Think on your own, and then compare notes with your table.

        <p>
            Pressure is a measure of the amount of force spread over an area.
            <me>P = \frac{F}{A}</me>
            where
            <ul>
                <li><m>P</m> is pressure</li>
                <li><m>F</m> is the force in units of pounds (lbs) or Newtons (N),</li>
                <li><m>A</m> is the area in units of square inches, or meters, or similar.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Walking on snow (or mud) is difficult because our feet tend to puncture the snow (high pressure applied to low strength snow). We can use snowshoes to avoid this problem: they reduce pressure with minimal increase in force (weight).
