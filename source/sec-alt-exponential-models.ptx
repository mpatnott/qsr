    <introduction>
        <p>
            In <xref ref="sec-alt-exponential-models-prep"/>, we investigated the growth of a colony of the bacteria <em>lactobacillus acidophilus</em>, part of turning milk into yogurt. We noted that based on experiments a new generation of bacteria are formed every 70 minutes, that is, the population doubles every 70 minutes, and assumed that when we start tracking the data we have 3 g of cells. If <m>a</m> is the number of 70-minute periods since we started tracking and <m>M(a)</m> is the mass of the colony, we found that <me>M(a) = 3 \cdot 2^a</me> is a formula that models the relationship between the colony's mass and the number of 70-minute periods.

        <p>
            The number <m>e \approx 2.71828</m> is often used as the base for exponential models in science, possibly because exponential models with base <m>e</m> play especially nicely with calculus. The number <m>e</m> is also used in finance to model <term>continuously compounded interest</term>, a useful theoretical tool. The amount, <m>A(t)</m>, that an initial deposit of <m>P</m> has grown to after <m>t</m> years in an account that is compounding continuously at a rate of <m>r\%</m> is <me>A(t) = Pe^{t \times r/100}</me>. We use the letter <m>P</m> for the initial deposit because it is often called the <term>principal</term>.

                Suppose Parker deposits $1000 into an account that earns interest at a rate of 2% per year. Parker doesn't remember how many times a year interest is compounded. Use the continuous compounding formula to find a model for the most money they could possibly have after <m>t</m> years (assuming they don't deposit any more money in the account).

Many calculators have a <m>\ln</m> button. It might seem strange to call <m>\log_e</m> the <q>natural</q> logarithm - there doesn't seem to be much about it that's natural!
