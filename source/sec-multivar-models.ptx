    <introduction>
        <p>
            <term>Resting energy expenditure (REE)</term> is the rate at which your body burns calories when you're not exercising in order to fuel normal bodily processes like breathing, thinking, non-exercise movement, digesting food, etc. Calculating REE has an important role in medical care. Critically ill patients under hospital care must be provided with sufficient calories to cover their REE and other energy needs.<fn><url href="https://rc.rcjournal.com/content/respcare/54/4/509.full.pdf" /></fn> A variety of equations have been used to predict REE in critically ill patients. Some of the equations used to predict REE in critically ill patients are shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the equations below use multiple variables to predict REE. Mathematical models that use more than one input variable to produce an output variable are called <term>multivariable models</term>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> American College of Chest Physicians equation: <m> REE = 25 * W </m></li>
            <li>
                <p>Harris-Benedict equations</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Men: <m> REE = 66.4730 + 13.7516 * W + 5.0033 * H - 6.7550 * A</m></li>
                    <li> Women: <m> REE = 655.0955 + 9.5634 * W + 1.8496 * H - 4.6756 * A</m></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Penn State 1998 equation: <m>REE = (1.1 * \text{value from Harris-Benedict}) + (140 * T_{max}) + (32 * V_E) - 5,340 </m></li>
            <li>Penn State 2003 equation: <m>REE = (0.85 * \text{value from Harris-Benedict}) + (175 * T_{max}) + (33 * V_E) - 6,433</m></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Notes about the variables in these equations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><m>REE</m> is measured in calories per day. </li>
            <li><m>W</m> is weight, measured in kilograms. </li>
            <li><m>H</m> is height, measured in centimeters. </li>
            <li><m>A</m> is age, measured in years. </li>
            <li><m>T_{max}</m> is the maximum body temperature in the past 24 hours, measured in Celsius.</li>
            <li><m>V_E</m> is a measure called <term>minute volume</term>, which is the volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled in one minute, measured in liters per minute. Normal levels are around 5 - 8 liters per minute. </li>
        </ul>
