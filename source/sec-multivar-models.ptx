    <introduction>
        <p>
            <term>Resting energy expenditure (REE)</term> is the rate at which your body burns calories when you're not exercising in order to fuel normal bodily processes like breathing, thinking, non-exercise movement, digesting food, etc. Calculating REE has an important role in medical care. Critically ill patients under hospital care must be provided with sufficient calories to cover their REE and other energy needs.<fn><url href="https://rc.rcjournal.com/content/respcare/54/4/509.full.pdf" /></fn> A variety of equations have been used to predict REE in critically ill patients. Some of the equations used to predict REE in critically ill patients are shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the equations below use multiple variables to predict REE. Mathematical models that use more than one input variable to produce an output variable are called <term>multivariable models</term>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> American College of Chest Physicians equation: <m> REE = 25 * W </m></li>
            <li>
                <p>Harris-Benedict equations</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Men: <m> REE = 66.4730 + 13.7516 * W + 5.0033 * H - 6.7550 * A</m></li>
                    <li> Women: <m> REE = 655.0955 + 9.5634 * W + 1.8496 * H - 4.6756 * A</m></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Penn State 1998 equation: <m>REE = (1.1 * \text{value from Harris-Benedict}) + (140 * T_{max}) + (32 * V_E) - 5,340 </m></li>
            <li>Penn State 2003 equation: <m>REE = (0.85 * \text{value from Harris-Benedict}) + (175 * T_{max}) + (33 * V_E) - 6,433</m></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Notes about the variables in these equations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><m>REE</m> is measured in calories per day. </li>
            <li><m>W</m> is weight, measured in kilograms. </li>
            <li><m>H</m> is height, measured in centimeters. </li>
            <li><m>A</m> is age, measured in years. </li>
            <li><m>T_{max}</m> is the maximum body temperature in the past 24 hours, measured in Celsius.</li>
            <li><m>V_E</m> is a measure called <term>minute volume</term>, which is the volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled in one minute, measured in liters per minute. Normal levels are around 5 - 8 liters per minute. </li>

                Multivariable models can also have inputs with non-linear relationships to the output. An example is seen in a fundamental equation in physics for kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the amount of energy an object has due to its motion. Think about an object moving toward you. The heavier the object and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has (the harder it will hit you). The equation for calculating kinetic energy is:
            </p>
            <me>K = 0.5*m*v^2</me>
            <p>
                where
                <ul>
                    <li><m>K = </m> kinetic energy, measured in joules</li>
                    <li><m>m =</m> mass of the object, in kilograms</li>
                    <li><m>v =</m> speed of the object, in meters per second</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task workspace = "0.5in">
            <p>
                To consider the importance of kinetic energy, imagine being hit by a tennis ball that is traveling 50 miles per hour (it would probably hurt). Now imagine being hit by an average sized car moving at 65 miles per hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                To quantify the difference, calculate the kinetic energy of the tennis ball and the car. Try this on your own first before sharing your answers in your group. Round to the nearest one hundredth of a joule. You will need: 
                <ul>

                    <li>An average sized car has a mass of 1500 kilograms.</li>
                    <li>To convert units: 1 kilogram = 1000 grams; 1 mile per hour ≈ 0.447 meters per second.</li>

                Your friend Dash is helping you search for a good used car to buy. They researched three cars yesterday and rated each car on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is the best, 1 is the worst) in four different categories. Dash's recommendations are shown in the table below. Dash recommended that you look at Car 3, because it has the highest average rating of the three cars.

                One way to show that some categories are more important than others would be to count that rating more times. For example, if Reliability is important, you can count it twice; if Comfort is even more important, you can count it four times. Your ratings might now look like this:

                    This kind of average, where some values are counted more times than others, is called a <term>weighted average</term>. The <em>weights</em> refer to how much each value is counted. In the above example, you could say that the categories of Gas Mileage and Cargo Space have weights equal to 1, Reliability has a weight of 2, and Interior Features/Comfort has a weight of 4. So, the total number of weights is 8. (1 for Gas Mileage, 1 for Cargo Space, 2 for Reliability, 4 for Interior Features/Comfort = 8 total weights.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Weighted average problems are specific cases of multivariable models. You might notice that the categories for rating the cars are acting as input variables used to calculate an overall score for <q>Car Quality</q> (weighted average), which is the output variable.

                It was noted above that weighted average models are specific cases of multivariable models. There are many multivariable models that are not weighted average models, for example, the REE equations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the weighted average model from Question 12 and compare it to the Harris-Benedict equation for males' REE (both shown below).
                <me>\text{Weighted Average:} \text{Car Quality} = \frac{10R + 5G + 20I + 5C}{40}</me>
                <me>\text{Harris-Benedict for males:} REE = 66.4730 + 13.7516 * W + 5.0033 * H - 6.7550 * A</me>
