                Consider an item initially priced at $549.9, but which has had its price reduced by 10% several times in a row.

            <p>
                Cars lose value over time. This is called <term>depreciation</term>. Let's use information from <url href="https://www.carfax.com/blog/car-depreciation">carfax.com</url> to analyze the change in the value of a brand new Subaru Crosstrek over time. Suppose the Crosstrek was purchased for $26,796.

                    The Carfax article says that the value of a new vehicle can drop by 20% after 1 year. Find the change factor, and use the change factor to estimate the value of Crosstrek in a year.

                    The Carfax article says that after the next four years, you can expect a car to lose about 15% of its value each year.

                    The Carfax article also says that 20% depreciation in the first year, followed by 15% depreciation for the next four years, is about the same as saying that a car is worth 40% of its purchase price after five years.
