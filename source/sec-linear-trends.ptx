                In 2022, Nelson created the following graph to represent his annual pay over the years.

                            Pay in 2012 was $24,000. In 2013 it was about $25,000. In 2014 it was about $27,000. In 2015 it was about $27,500. In 2016 it was about $28,500. In 2017 it was about $28,500. In 2018 it was about $29,000. In 2019 it as about $30,000. In 2020 it was about $31,000. In 2021 it was about $31,500. In 2022 it was $32,000.

                   Nelson is using <em>extrapoloation</em> to predict his future salary, so his prediction is unlikely to be perfect and could even be quite a bit off. Extrapolation is the process of using a mathematical model to make predictions that are outside the range of the available data, based on the assumption that existing trends will continue. The problem with extrapolation is that the trend could change in the future, for any number of reasons, which would make the prediction unreliable. Give at least one example of way that the trend in Nelson's salary might change and result his prediction being very wrong.

    <p>
        Every year, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project releases an analysis of land-surface temperature records (some going back as far as 250 years).<fn><url href="https://berkeleyearth.org/"></url></fn> According to Berkeley Earth, "The analysis shows that the rise [or growth] in average world land temperature[is]... about 1.3 degrees Celsius."" BEST states that "global warming is real,"" and attributes the temperature trend to a combination of volcanoes and CO<sub>2</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are others who are skeptical of the theory of "global warming" and hold a contrary view of weather data. These people believe that there are other explanations and reasons for the climate changes being experienced. In the next two activities, we are going to examine the Berkeley Earth project data and linear models for Global Surface Temperature Change to study the issue of global warming.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the website <url href="https://skepticalscience.com/" visual="skepticalscience.com"></url>, the data from the Berkeley Earth project has been used as the source for two different analyses of the same information. The first one is labeled "How Realists View Global Warming" and the other is "How Contrarians View Global Warming." The two infographics are reproduced here. You will see that each includes a line or line segments along with the actual data. Use these infographics to answer the following questions.

            <p>
                Below is an infographic showing the data gathered by BEST showing the monthly "Global Temperature Anomaly" (that is, the change in average Global Temperature, in degrees Celsius) for the years 1970-2022. Shown on the graph is a trendline, also known as a line of best fit, that is a linear model representing the trend of the data. It is stated on the project's website that the baseline period is the 1850-1900 mean.<fn><url href="https://skepticalscience.com/escalator_2022.html"></url></fn> This means that the data from 1970-2022 is compared with the data from 1850-1900.

                            The temperature difference has a lot of variation over short time periods, but over the entire 1970 to 2022 time period, the differences tend to increase. Exact points on the trend line are hard to estimate, but it appears that (1970, 0.25) and (2022, 1.28) are both approximately on the line.
