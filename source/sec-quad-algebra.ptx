  <title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>

   <introduction>
    <p>
        The <term>quadratic formula</term> is a tool for solving quadratic equations. If we have a quadratic equation in standard form <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me> then the quadratic formula tells us that the solutions are <me>x = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \text{ and } x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's find the solutions to <me>3x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0</me>. Since <m>a = 3</m>, <m>b = 6</m>, and <m>c = -7</m>, the quadratic formula tells us that the solutions are <me>x = \frac{-6 - \sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(-7)}}{2(3)} \text{ and } x = \frac{-6 + \sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(-7)}}{2(3)}</me> or <m>x = -2.826</m> and <m>x = 0.826</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's easy to make a mistake when using the quadratic formula, so it's a good idea to check your answers by plugging them back in. Since <me>(-2.826)^2 + 6(-2.826) - 7 \approx 0.0028 \approx 0</me> and <me>(0.826)^2 + 6(0.826) - 7 \approx 0.0028 \approx 0</me>, it looks like our answers are probably right and the only reason we're not getting exactly <m>0</m> is rounding.
    </p>
    <p>
        <alert>Caution:</alert> It's very important when using the quadratic formula that your equation is in standard form <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>. If it's not, you need to rewrite the equation to put it into standard form before you can use the quadratic formula.

        <p>
            The apparent temperature or heat index is a measure of how hot it feels despite what the thermometer says. The more moisture that is in the air the hotter it will feel. If the actual temperature is <m>90^\circ</m>F, then the heat index, <m>I</m>, can be modeled by the formula <me>I = 0.007h^2 - 0.257h + 90.979</me> where <m>h</m> is the humidity percent.
