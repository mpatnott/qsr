  <title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>

   <introduction>
    <p>
        The <term>quadratic formula</term> is a tool for solving quadratic equations. If we have a quadratic equation in standard form <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me> then the quadratic formula tells us that the solutions are <me>x = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \text{ and } x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's find the solutions to <me>3x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0</me>. Since <m>a = 3</m>, <m>b = 6</m>, and <m>c = -7</m>, the quadratic formula tells us that the solutions are <me>x = \frac{-6 - \sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(-7)}}{2(3)} \text{ and } x = \frac{-6 + \sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(-7)}}{2(3)}</me> or <m>x = -2.826</m> and <m>x = 0.826</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's easy to make a mistake when using the quadratic formula, so it's a good idea to check your answers by plugging them back in. Since <me>(-2.826)^2 + 6(-2.826) - 7 \approx 0.0028 \approx 0</me> and <me>(0.826)^2 + 6(0.826) - 7 \approx 0.0028 \approx 0</me>, it looks like our answers are probably right and the only reason we're not getting exactly <m>0</m> is rounding.
    </p>
    <p>
        <alert>Caution:</alert> It's very important when using the quadratic formula that your equation is in standard form <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>. If it's not, you need to rewrite the equation to put it into standard form before you can use the quadratic formula.

    <introduction>
        <p>
            People have been solving quadratic equations for thousands of years! The Berlin Papyrus 6619 was probably written in about 1800 BCE in Egypt, and contains two math problems. Both math problems can be solved by thinking about quadratic equations (although that's not how the Egyptians would have solved them - they didn't know the quadratic formula, or have our modern algebra notation).
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the first problem:
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    You are told the area of a square of 100 square cubits is equal to that of two smaller squares, the side of one square is 1/2 + 1/4 of the other. What are the sides of the two unknown squares?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            Let's try to solve this problem! There are three squares in this problem:
            <ul>
                <li>Big square has area 100 square cubits. </li>
                <li>Small square #1: Let's call it's side length <m>x</m>.</li>
                <li>Small square #2: It's side length of 1/2 + 1/4 of <m>x</m>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <task workspace="0.75in">
        <statement>
            <p>
                What's the side length of the big square? How do you know?

                The problem says that small square #2 has side length of 1/2 + 1/4 of <m>x</m>. From a modern perspective, that's a weird way to write that (it was normal in ancient Egypt!)! Rewrite the side length of small square \#2 in a way that seems more normal from a modern perspective.

                The problem tells us that the big square's area is equal to the two smaller squares put together. Use this information to set up an equation, then use the quadratic formula to solve it and find the side length of small square #1.
