            <p>
                In <xref ref="sec-functions-prep"/>, we introduced function notation and practiced using it with tables and graphs. Function notation is also often used with formulas.

                The velocity, in feet per second, of a car that slammed on its brakes can be determined based on the length of the skid marks that its tires left on the ground. Suppose that on a particular surface, this relationship is given by <me>v(d) = \sqrt{32d}</me>, where <m>d</m> is the length of the skid marks in feet.

    We have mostly used the word <q>model</q> to refer to relationships between quantities in this class. A function, like a model, is a relationship between quantities. To be a function, a relationship needs to follow a special rule.

   <definition xml:id="def-function">
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <term>function</term> is a relationship between an input quantity and an output quantity in which every input quantity is matched to exactly one output quantity. When a relationship is a function, we say that <q>output is a function of input</q>.
        </p>
    </statement>
   </definition>
   <p>
    We'll focus on identifying relationships that aren't functions because some inputs have more than one output. For example, in the graph below, <m>y</m> is NOT a function of <m>x</m>, because, for example, <m>x = 5</m> maps to two values of <m>y</m>.
