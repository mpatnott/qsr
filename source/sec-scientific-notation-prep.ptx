        <p>
            Very large and very small numbers are hard to work with and understand. Consider the meme below, which made its way around the internet in the mid-2010s:
        </p> 
        <figure xml:id="fig-powerball-meme">
            <caption>Powerball Math</caption>
            <image source="./images/powerball-meme.png" width="50%">
                <shortdescription>Powerball 1.3 billion divided by US pop 300 million = 4.33 mil per person</shortdescription>

                    <p>
                        Powerball 1.3 billion divided by US pop 300 million = 4.33 mil per person. Poverty solved!

        <p>
            Below is a table that describes some large numbers in words, standard decimal notation, and <term>scientific notation</term>. Notice that: 
            <ul>
                <li> Numbers written in scientific notation always have one nonzero number to the left of the decimal, but can have as money numbers as desired/needed to the right of the decimal.</li>
                <li> Scientific notation always include <q><m>\times 10^{\text{some power}}</m></q></li>
                <li> Scientific notation keeps track of the number of decimal places to the right of the first digit but before the decimal point using the exponent.</li>
            </ul>
            Keeping track of the number of decimal places in quantities can be useful for some estimation problems and in helping us to work with and think about large numbers.

            Words like <q>million</q> and <q>billion</q> help us describe large numbers. These words have not been used consistently throughout time and across cultures to refer to the same numbers. We will use the convention described in the table below. Note that the table shows <q>ten million</q> and <q>hundered million</q>; <q>ten thousand</q>, <q>hundred thousand</q>, <q>ten billion</q>, etc. work similarly.

    <introduction>
        <p>
            It's often convenient to round when working with large numbers. To round large numbers:
            <ul>
                <li> Decide what place value to round to.</li>
                <li> 
                    <p>
                        Look at the number to the immediate right of the place value you're rounding to.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If it is <m>5</m> or higher, round up. That is, increase the digit you are rounding to by one and change all of the numbers to the right of it to zeroes.</li>
                        <li>If it is <m>4</m> or lower, round down. That is, change to zeroes all of the numbers to the right of the place value to which you are rounding. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            For example,
            <ul>
                <li>12,650 rounded to the nearest thousand is 13,000</li>
                <li>12,499 rounded to the nearest thousand is 12,000</li>
                <li>65,452,120 rounded to the nearest million is 65,000,000</li>
                <li>12,811,120 rounded to the nearest million is 13,000,000</li>
