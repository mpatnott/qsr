                The 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act established a federal minimum wage of $0.25 per hour in the United States. The federal minimum wage has been increased many times since it was established in 1938.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the federal minimum wage data<fn><url href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart#fn1" /></fn> from 1938 to 2009, we can estimate that the minimum wage increased, on average, by about 4.94% each year.

            <p>
                The federal minimum wage increased much more frequently between 1938 and 1981 then it has since 1981. If we use only the federal minimum wage data up to 1981, we find that it increased, on average, at about 6.14% per year during that time period. The data between 1938 and 1981 is also closer to fitting an exponential model than if we look at all of the data up to 2009.

The Living Wage Institute estimates that the living wage for a single adult with one child<fn><url href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/08" /></fn> in Colorado is $47.11 per hour. In this scenario, when would the federal minimum wage be at least the living wage for a single adult with a child in Colorado?
