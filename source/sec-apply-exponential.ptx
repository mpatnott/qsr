                The 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act established a federal minimum wage of $0.25 per hour in the United States. The federal minimum wage has been increased many times since it was established in 1938.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the federal minimum wage data<fn><url href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart#fn1" /></fn> from 1938 to 2009, we can estimate that the minimum wage increased, on average, by about 4.94% each year.

            <p>
                The federal minimum wage increased much more frequently between 1938 and 1981 then it has since 1981. If we use only the federal minimum wage data up to 1981, we find that it increased, on average, at about 6.14% per year during that time period. The data between 1938 and 1981 is also closer to fitting an exponential model than if we look at all of the data up to 2009.

                Prices increase over time due to inflation. Inflation varies from year to year, but we can calculate average annual inflation and use it to study price increases over a time period. Inflation also varies between categories of goods and services: some types of goods and services have experienced faster inflation than others in recent years.

                Inflation measures price increases over time. The impact that price increases due to inflation have on people's lives depends not only on inflation itself, but also on whether or not their wages are increasing by a corresponding amount. According to the US Census Bureau<fn><url href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1987/demo/p60-156.html" /></fn>, the median US household income was $23,260 in 1985.
