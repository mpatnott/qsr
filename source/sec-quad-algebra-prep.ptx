            <p>
                An equation that can be written in the form <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are any number, is called a <term>quadratic equation</term>. The form <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m> is sometimes called the <term>standard form</term> for a quadratic equation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rewrite each of the equations below in standard form, and find the values of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Quadratic equations with <m>b = 0</m> are easier to solve than quadratic equations with <m>b \neq 0</m>. For example, to solve
                <me>3x^2 - 12 = 0</me>
                we first add <m>12</m> to both sides to get
                <me>3x^2 = 12</me>.
                Next, we divide both sides by <m>3</m> and get
                <me>x^2 = 4</me>.
                Finally, we take the square root of both sides, being careful not to forget the negative square root, to get the answers
                <me>x = 2, x = -2</me>.
            </p>
