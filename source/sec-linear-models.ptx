                Many old comic books contained ads offering money-making schemes to children reading the comics.<fn><url href=" http://mentalfloss.com/article/57958/6-get-rich-quick-schemes-vintage-comic-books"></url></fn> As an example, suppose a company offered to send 30 greeting cards to a child to sell to relatives, friends, and neighbors. The child was to sell them for <m>m</m> dollars each, and had to send <m>b</m> dollars back to the company. Here is a graph of a linear model representing the situation. The input (horizontal value) represents the number of cards sold, and the output (vertical value) represents the child's profit in dollars.

                Data plans for cell phone plans can be purchased in two different ways. One is an unlimited data plan where the customer pays a set monthly fee for unlimited data. The other is a per-gigabyte (GB) pricing service where the customer pays a set monthly fee plus a specified amount for each GB. The GBs are not prorated (that means it doesn't matter if the customer uses 0.001 GB or 1 GB, they must still pay for the entire 1 GB). The cost of the phone itself and other fees are the same amount under each plan.
