                    If Audryn left a $12.25 tip on a $68.00 bill, then she left an 18% tip. She paid $80.24 in totla, or 118% of the original bill.

                    If August bought a shirt that originally cost $25 but was 15% off, then he paid $21.25 for the shirt. The price he paid was 85% of the original price.

                    The <term>percent change</term> or <term>relative change</term> is the percent increase or decrease from the initial value. The percent change is negative if it's a decrease.

                <p>
                    The <term>change factor</term> is the new value as a percent of the original value, divided by 100.

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In April 2025, the Trump Administration raised tariffs on goods imported to the US. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) initially published a <url href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-I.pdf">table of new tariffs</url>, but followed up with more <url href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Issue_Areas/Presidential%20Tariff%20Action/Reciprocal%20Tariff%20Calculations.pdf">details on the calculations</url>. The White House calls the new tariffs <q>reciprocal tariffs</q> in the <url href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/">Executive Order authorizing the new rates</url>, and the document explaining the calculations says that <q>Reciprocal tariffs are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the U.S. and each of our trading partners.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the USTR document explaining the calculation, the formula used to calculate the new tariff rates is
            <me>
                \Delta\tau_i = \frac{x_i - m_i}{\epsilon \times \phi \times m_i}   
            </me>.
            This looks complicated! The document tells us that the variables here are
            <ul>
                <li><m>\Delta\tau_i = \text{Change in tariff rate (%) on Country } i</m> (this is what we're calculating)</li>
                <li><m>x_i = \text{Total exports from US to Country } i</m></li>
                <li><m>m_i = \text{Total imports from US to Country } i</m></li>
                <li><m>\epsilon = \text{Elasticity of imports with respect to import prices}</m></li>  
                <li><m>\phi = \text{Passthrough from tariffs to import prices}</m></li>
            </ul>
            Although <m>x_i</m> and <m>m_i</m> are both numbers that we could look up, <m>\epsilon</m> and <m>\phi</m> are numbers whose values aren't certain. Depending on the assumptions you make, you could reasonably get differnt values for <m>\epsilon</m> and <m>\phi</m>. The document tells us that the Trump Administration assumed that <m>\epsilon = -4</m> and <m>\phi = 0.25</m>. Since <m>4 \times 0.25 = -1</m>, all of this information lets us rewrite the very complicated looking formula as
            <me>
                \text{Change in Tariff Rate} = \frac{\text{Exports} - \text{Imports}}{-\text{Imports}}
            </me>.

                        Reports about the new tariff rates generally gave one of two explanations for the reasoning behind the formula:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It calculates a fair tariff rate that takes into account the tariffs a country charges on imported US goods, plus other factors that make it hard for the US to export to that country.</li>
                        <li>It calculates the percent difference between the amount of goods imported to a country from the US and the amount of goods exported from that country to the US.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Which of these explanations matches the formula more closely? Explain your answer.

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    The Trump Administration did two more steps after using the formula (which they claim gives the fair tariff rate):
                    <ol>
                        <li>Divide the answer by 2, to get the discounted tariff rate that the US will actually use in order to be nice.</li>
                        <li>If your answer is now less than 10%, ignore it and just use 10% instead.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Use these last two steps to find the actual new tariff rates for each of the following countries/regions:
