                    If Audryn left a $12.25 tip on a $68.00 bill, then she left an 18% tip. She paid $80.24 in totla, or 118% of the original bill.

                    If August bought a shirt that originally cost $25 but was 15% off, then he paid $21.25 for the shirt. The price he paid was 85% of the original price.

                    The <term>initial value</term> is the original amount.

                <p>
                    The <term>percent change</term> or <term>relative change</term> is the percent increase or decrease from the initial value. The percent change is negative if it's a decrease.

            <li>
                <p>
                    The <term>change factor</term> is the new value as a percent of the original value, divided by 100.

                The news report included the median rent in 2024, but not the median rent in 2023! That is, it gave us the new value, instead of the initial value. Use the new value (given in the problem statement) and the change factor to find the initial value (the median rent in 2023).
