          Media outlets regularly publish rankings of cell phone carriers, travel destinations, colleges, TVs, and credit cards, just to mention a few.
      </p>

      <p> 
          Here's an example of one such ranking - the "<url href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/062016/6-countries-where-you-can-live-social-security.asp" visual="www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/062016/6-countries-where-you-can-live-social-security.asp">Best Places to Retire on Earth</url>," according to <url href="https://www.investopedia.com/" visual="investopedia.com">investopedia.com</url>. To determine which countries are the best for retirees, they used a scoring system that measured seven categories:
      </p>
      <ul cols="3">
          <li> Visa/benefits </li>
          <li> Climate </li>
          <li> Cost of living </li>
          <li> Development </li>
          <li> Healthcare </li>
          <li> Housing </li>
          <li> Affinity rating </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          The top 4 countries with the highest cumulative average score across all those categories are Costa Rica, Portugal, Mexico, and Panama.
      </p>
      <p>
          When creating rankings like the one above, we first need to decide what factors (variables) will contribute to the overall ranking. Then, we need to decide how those factors can be measured (quantified). Finally, we need a formula that combines all of them into one overall score.
      </p>

      Important factors for a decision or situation are called <term>variables</term>. Variables that have values that are numbers called <term>quantitative variables</term>.

        In your group, agree on a topic that interests everyone (or most of you!), and try to come up with a strategy to create a ranking system related to that topic. After agreeing on a topic, think about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What variables to use;</li>
        <li>How to measure those variables; and</li>
        <li>How to combine all of them into one overall score.</li>

          Every year, <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> publishes a list of the best colleges in the United States. Colleges on the list are ranked based on many different factors, such as first-year student retention, graduation rates, and faculty strength.

            Using what you know about how <em>U.S. News</em> ranks colleges, discuss what things you might include in your decision in choosing a college. That is, what factors would be important to your decision?

      A <term>mathematical model</term> is a description of a system, or situation, using mathematical concepts, language, and numbers. People often use variables to help create mathematical models. Mathematical models can be represented as equations, tables, graphs, or descriptions in words.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's look at a mathematical model for ranking community colleges that combines variables to give us one number for each community college. The Aspen Institute  awards the Aspen Prize every other year. The award "honors those institutions that strive for and achieve exceptional levels of success for all students, while they are in college and after they graduate."<fn><url href="http://highered.aspeninstitute.org/projects/"></url></fn> In addition to the prestige of winning this award, the winning college also receives a $1 million cash prize. To determine the 150 finalists for the award, the Aspen Institute collects information from 1000 community colleges related to the following variables:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Performance</strong> - The performance score measures student success in persistence, degrees awarded, completion, and transfer;</li>
          <li><strong>Change</strong> - The change score measures consistent improvement in these areas over time; and</li>
          <li><strong>Minority Achievement and Family Income</strong> - The minority achievement score and family income score measure equitable outcomes for students of all racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.</li>
        </ol>
        Each of these scores is created from combining a great deal of information about many factors.

            The Aspen institute used the following <em>mathematical model equation</em> to calculate a score for each school:
            <me>R = 0.33P + 0.33C + 0.27M + 0.07F</me>
            where:
            <ul cols="2">
              <li><m>R =</m> Overall ranking score (higher scores are best)</li>
              <li><m>P =</m> Performance score</li>
              <li><m>C =</m> Change score</li>
              <li><m>M =</m> Minority score</li>
              <li><m>F =</m> Family income score</li>
            </ul>
            Use this equation to calculate the overall score for each of the schools and enter it into the table above. According to the overall score you calculated, which school is best?
