          Media outlets regularly publish rankings of cell phone carriers, travel destinations, colleges, TVs, and credit cards, just to mention a few.
      </p>

      <p> 
          Here's an example of one such ranking - the "<url href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/062016/6-countries-where-you-can-live-social-security.asp" visual="www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/062016/6-countries-where-you-can-live-social-security.asp">Best Places to Retire on Earth</url>," according to <url href="https://www.investopedia.com/" visual="investopedia.com">investopedia.com</url>. To determine which countries are the best for retirees, they used a scoring system that measured seven categories:
      </p>
      <ul cols="2">
          <li> Visa/benefits </li>
          <li> Climate </li>
          <li> Cost of living </li>
          <li> Development </li>
          <li> Healthcare </li>
          <li> Housing </li>
          <li> Affinity rating </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          The top 4 countries with the highest cumulative average score across all those categories are Costa Rica, Portugal, Mexico, and Panama.
      </p>
      <p>
          When creating rankings like the one above, we first need to decide what factors (variables) will contribute to the overall ranking. Then, we need to decide how those factors can be measured (quantified). Finally, we need a formula that combines all of them into one overall score.
      </p>

    <p>
      Important factors for a decision or situation are called <term>variables</term>. Variables that have values that are numbers called <term>quantitative variables</term>.

        In your group, agree on a topic that interests everyone (or most of you!), and try to come up with a strategy to create a ranking system related to that topic. For example, you could think about how youâ€™d rank the restaurants in your area. After agreeing on a topic, think about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What variables to use;</li>
        <li>How to measure those variables; and</li>
        <li>How to combine all of them into one overall score.</li>
      </ul>

          Every year, <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> publishes a list of the best colleges in the United States. Colleges on the list are ranked based on many different factors, such as first-year student retention, graduation rates, and faculty strength.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task workspace="1in">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Using what you know about how <em>U.S. News</em> ranks colleges, discuss what things you might include in your decision in choosing a college. That is, what factors would be important to your decision?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task workspace="1in">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Brainstorm how numeric values could be used to quantify (express with numbers) the variables you identified above. Include the units of measurement.
          </p>

    <p>A <term>mathematical model</term> is a description of a system, or situation, using mathematical concepts, language, and numbers. People often use variables to help create mathematical models. Mathematical models can be represented as equations, tables, graphs, or descriptions in words.</p>
