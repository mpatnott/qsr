    <introduction>
        <p>
            Percentages are a common way to describe a quantity of interest (the <q>part</q>) as a fraction of a base quantity (the <q>whole</q>).  The equations
            <me>\text{Percent} = \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \times 100, \qquad \text{Part} = \frac{\text{Percent}}{100} \times \text{Whole}</me>
            can be used to find the percent or the part.

                The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a census of the U.S. population every ten years.
