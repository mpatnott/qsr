                Some of the problems in the Practice Assignments use notation like <m>f(x)</m>. Although this looks like it says <m>f</m> times <m>x</m>, that's not what it actually means! This notation is called <term>function notation</term>, and is read <q><m>f</m> of <m>x</m></q>. It has three parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>f</m> is the <term>name</term> of the function or model
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><m>x</m> is the <term>input</term></li>
                    <li><m>f(x)</m> all together is the <term>output</term>. If we have <m>f(x) = y</m>, then <m>y</m> is also the output.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Identify the input, output, and function name in each of the math sentences below.

                Function notation is a compact way to keep track of and connect several pieces of information. Let's practice interpreting it in an example.

                Using function notation, we can write the sentence <q>13% of US adults used Instagram in 2012</q> as <m>P(2012) = 13%</m>.
            </p>

                    We can use the table to evaluate expressions in function notation. For example, if we're asked <q>Evaluate <m>P(2018)</m></q>, the table tells us the answer is <m>35</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evaluate <m>P(2021)</m>.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    We can also use the table to solve equations in function notation. For example, if we're asked <q>Solve the equation <m>P(y) = 17</m></q>, the answer is <m>y = 2014</m>, since that's the year in which <m>17%</m> of US adults used Instagram, according to the table.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solve the equation <m>P(y) = 28</m>.
