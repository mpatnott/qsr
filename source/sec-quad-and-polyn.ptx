    <introduction>
        <p>
            Edna makes ceramic gnomes to sell at a local craft market each week. The cost of her ceramic-making equipment is $100 and the cost of supplies per gnome is $15. If the selling price per gnome is $50 then Edna will sell 28 gnomes per week but if she drops the price to $45 per gnome then she will sell 32 of them per week.

                A <term>price-demand function</term> is a mathematical model the describes the relationship between the selling price of an item and the demand, i.e., the number of items sold. Let <m>p</m> be the selling price for one of Edna's gnomes and <m>x</m> be the number of gnomes Edna sells. Assume that the relationship between <m>p</m> and <m>x</m> is linear, and use the information given in the problem statement to find a linear model for the price-demand function for Edna's gnomes.

                You should have found a negative slope for your price-demand function. Why does it make sense that the slope would be negative in this context? That is, why does it make sense that the price-demand function is decreasing?

                The model <m>R = xp</m> is a multivariable model for revenue. It's often useful to turn multivariable models into single variable models, when possible, because many of the mathematical tools we use to analyze models are simpler when there are fewer variables. We can get a model for revenue that includes only <m>R</m> and <m>x</m> (the number of items sold) by replacing <m>p</m> with the price-demand function.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, Manuel sells handmade cutting boards at the craft fair. His price-demand function for his cutting boards is <me>p = 90 - 2(x - 17)</me>. That means his revenue is <me>R = x(90 - 2(x-17))</me>. <alert>Note:</alert> The parentheses are important! In order to find revenue, we need to multiply the number of items sold by the price of an item. If Manuel wrote his revenue model as <me>R = x\times 90 - 2(x-17)</me>, then his model would find number of items sold times 90, then subtract <m>2(x-17)</m>, instead of number of items sold times that price of the item (which is <m>90 - 2(x-17)</m>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Find a single variable model for Edna's revenue by replacing <m>p</m> with your price-demand function.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Manuel's revenue model is kind of messy! He decides to clean it up using distribution. First, he uses the distributive property to rewrite <m>-2(x - 17) = -2x + 34</m>. This gives him <me>R = x(90 - 2x + 34)</me>, which he simplifies by adding 90 and 34 to get <me>R = x(124 - 2x)</me>. Finally, Manuel distributes the <m>x</m> to get <me>R = 124x - 2x^2</me>. 
            </p>

                Use the distributive property to clean up your model for Edna's revenue.

    <introduction>
        <p>
            The models we found for revenue in <xref ref="a-price-demand-revenue"/> are <term>polynomials</term>. A <term>polynomial</term> model can be written as a sum of nonnegative whole number powers of a variable times constants. In formal symbols, we can write a polynomial in the form <me>a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0</me> for some nonegative whole number <m>n</m> and numbers <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_0</m>. The numbers that are multiplied by the variable and its powers are called <term>coefficients.</term>
        </p>
        <p>
            The highest power in a polynomial is called the <term>degree</term> of the polynomial. The <term>leading coefficient</term> is the coefficient of the highest power. A polynomial of degree 2 is also called a <term>quadratic</term> model.
