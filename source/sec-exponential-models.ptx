                We have seen that when a quantity increases or decreases by the same amount for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as a linear model. That is, linear models have a constant average rate of change. For example, think of getting a $500 raise every year; in this case, the average rate of change is $500/year.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a quantity increases or decreases by the same percentage for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as an <term>exponential model</term>. Exponential models have a constant percent change and a constant change factor. For example, think of getting a 3% raise every year; in this case, the constant change factor is 1.03.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determine which of the data sets below have a linear model, which have an exponential model, and which have neither.
