        <p>
            We have seen that when a quantity increases or decreases by the same amount for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as a linear model. That is, linear models have a constant average rate of change. For example, think of getting a $500 raise every year.

            When a quantity increases or decreases by the same percentage for each additional unit of the input variable, the value of the output variable can be modeled as an <term>exponential model</term>. Exponential models have a constant relative change. For example, think of getting a 3% raise every year.

                We looked at the populations of three small towns in the Prep Activities. All three towns had a population of 5500 in 2010, but their populations were changing in different ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Indiana: Increasing by 2.5% each year</li>
                    <li>Ohio: Decreasing by 2.5% each year</li>
                    <li>Michigan: Decreasing by 150 people each year</li>
                </ul>

                    In the Prep Activity, you found the populations of all three towns in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2020. You also learned that the math expressions <m>5500 + 5500(0.025)</m> and <m>5500 \times 1.025</m> are equivalent. Use this idea to rewrite your work for finding the populations of the two towns with exponential models. What pattern do you see?

                Suppose that the cost of attending a certain four-year private college (tuition and fees) was $16,500 in 1977 and that the cost increased about 3.2% every year.

                    Explain one strategy you could use to determine the year when this model would predict a cost of $42,000. Assume we are using the original cost of $16,500 for 1977.
