        <introduction>
            <p>
                In the real world, it is more common to have data that is approximately linear than exactly linear. These activities will introduce the idea of linear trends, which we'll spend more time in class. They'll also provide practice with building a linear model by identifying its slope and vertical intercept.

                    Several years ago, Onondaga Community College, in upstate New York, introduced a meal plan that included "Flex Dollars" that were stored on students' ID cards. Each student was given $150 "Flex Dollars" as part of their meal plan package that could be used like cash at several campus dining locations.
                </p>

                        To accommodate instances where you do not wish to purchase a "meal", but would still like something to eat or drink, the College offers $150 of "Flex Dollars" included in each meal plan package. This "flexible money" may be used just like cash for any item sold in the Gordon Café, Mawhinney Café, Starbucks or Fresh Express. Do you want that Large Mocha at Starbucks or that pint of Ben and Jerry's from Mawhinney Café? Use your flex dollars to pay for it!
                    </p>

                    Onondaga student Loralee tracked her use of flex dollars weekly during the fall semester as shown in the table below:

                <p>
                    Smartphones, like many other manufactured goods, depreciate on a daily basis. Depreciation means how much an item (e.g. a smartphone) loses in value compared to the price that was originally paid for it from the manufacturer. There tends to be two main periods in a smartphone's life when it sees the biggest drops in value: 1. the period of time after the phone is initially purchased, and 2. when the manufacturer launches a new model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September 2019, the iPhone 11 256GB was released with a price of $849. Twelve months after the launch, it was found that the value of iPhone 11s depreciated about 37% (which is actually better than most smartphone depreciation!).<fn><url href="https://www.decluttr.com/phone-depreciation/"></url></fn>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose Coraline bought a new iPhone 11 256GB in September 2019 for $849. The phone would soon start depreciating in value. The following table shows the approximate value of her iPhone 11, by month from September 2019.

                        It can be easier to work with models when the data are numerical. Modify the first row of the table to change the months into numbers. There isn't a "right" way to do this, although it is important that Jan 2020's number be bigger than Dec 2019's.
