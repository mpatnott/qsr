            In <xref ref="sec-linear-models"/>, we explored the cost of electricity in and around Denver, CO, during the summer for customers on the Residential Opt-Out Pricing Plan. We knew that the rates for this plan are<fn><url href="https://co.my.xcelenergy.com/s/billing-payment/residential-rates/residential-plan"></url></fn>.

                    Now, let's consider the cost of electricity in and around Denver in the winter. Use the information given in the table above to build a linear model for the bill amount, <m>B</m>, of a customer that uses <m>k</m> kWh in the winter.

Let <m>B</m> be the monthly bill amount and <m>k</m> be the number of kWh used.

A customer who used 1000 kWh in a month would be charged <m>B = 8.07 + 0.06002 \times 800 + 0.04766 \times (1000 - 800) = B = 8.07 + 0.06002 \times 800 + 0.04766 \times 200 = $65.62</m>

                        This situation is called "Piecewise Defined." It is piecewise because the cost changes based on the amount of electricity used; cost per kWh is not constant so the graph if this situation is not a line.
