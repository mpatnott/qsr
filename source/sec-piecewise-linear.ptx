        <introduction>
            <p>
                The situation in <xref ref="a-entergy-winter"/> is called <q>piecewise defined</q> or a <q>piecewise linear model.</q> It is piecewise because the cost changes based on the amount of electricity used. Cost per kWh is not constant, so the graph of this situation is not a line. But it is piecewise linear, because cost per kWh is constant on each piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                We found that when the number of kilowatt hours used, <m>k</m> is 800 or less, the bill is <m>B(k) = 8.07 + 0.06002k</m>. When the number of kilowatt hours used is more than 800, <me>B(k) = 8.07 + 0.06002 \times 800 + 0.04766(k - 800)</me>, or <me>B(k) = 56.086 + 0.04766(k-800)</me>. Mathematicians like to put both of these equations together like this:
                <me>
                    B(k) = \begin{cases}
                            8.07 + 0.06002k, \amp k \leq 800 \\
                            56.086 + 0.04766(k-800), \amp k \gt 800
                        \end{cases}
                </me>
                The { symbol is there to tell you that this is a piecewise formula. The <m>k \leq 800</m> at the end of the first line tells you to use that part of the formula when <m>k</m> is 800 or less. The <m>k \gt 800</m> at the end of the second line tells you to use that part of the formula when <m>k</m> is bigger than 800.

                In order to conserve water, the Detroit area water system has a two-tiered system of charges. Customers are billed quarterly (every three months) for water usage. The cost to customers is $12.04 per thousand gallons for the first 20,000 gallons of water used, and $21.90 for each thousand gallons over 20,000. In addition there is always a flat quarterly fee of $73.00.

            <p>
                Julio is moving from one apartment to another apartment in a neighboring town. He needs to rent a truck for one day to move his belongings. Julio uses the Internet to search for companies with trucks for rent. He finds two companies that have trucks available on the day he needs one: Rent-A-Truk and Trucks-4-Less. 
                <ul>
                    <li> Rent-A-Truk advertises a rate of $40 for the day, plus 60 cents a mile for every mile over 40 miles. </li>
                    <li> Trucks-4-Less advertises a rate of $25 a day plus 80 cents a mile for every mile over 25 miles. </li>
                </ul>

                    Julio might want to know at what mileage the cost of the Rent-A-Truk plan equals the cost of the Trucks-4-Less plan. Use your algebraic models to write one equation, using only the variable <m>x</m>, that represents this situation. <br/>
                    <strong>Hint:</strong> You can think about this situation as <m>R(x) = T(x)</m>. <br />
                    <strong>Hint:</strong> Julio estimated that this situation occurs at a mileage higher than 40.
