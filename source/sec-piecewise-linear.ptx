            In <xref ref="sec-linear-models"/>, we explored the cost of electricity in and around Denver, CO, during the summer for customers on the Residential Opt-Out Pricing Plan. We knew that the rates for this plan are<fn><url href="https://co.my.xcelenergy.com/s/billing-payment/residential-rates/residential-plan"></url></fn>.

            The situation in <xref ref="a-entergy-winter"/> is called "piecewise defined" or a "piecewise linear model." It is piecewise because the cost changes based on the amount of electricity used. Cost per kWh is not constant so the graph if this situation is not a line. It is piecewise <em>linear</em> because the graph has two pieces, and cost per kWh is constant on each piece.

            We found that when the number of kilowatt hours used, <m>k</m> is 800 or less, the bill is <m>B = 8.07 + 0.06002k</m>. When the number of kilowatt hours used is more than 800, <m>B = 8.07 + 0.06002 \times 800 + 0.04766(k - 800)</m>, or <m>B = 56.086 + 0.04766(k-800)</m>. Mathematicians like to put both of these equations together like this:
            <me>
                B = \begin{cases}
                        8.07 + 0.06002k \amp k \leq 800 \\
                        56.086 + 0.04766(k-800) \amp k \gt 800
                    \end{cases}
