                The area of a square can be modeled by the formula <me>A = s^2</me> where <m>s</m> is the length of a side of the square and <m>A</m> is the square's area.

            <p>
                A <term>power model</term> is a relationship between two quantities that can be written in the form <me>Q_2 = c \times Q_1^p</me>, where <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_2</m> are the two quantities, <m>c</m> is a number called the <term>coefficient</term> and <m>p</m> is a number called the <term>power</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the area of a square model is a power model. The two quantities are the area (<m>A</m>) and the side length (<m>s</m>), the coefficient is <m>1</m>, and the power is <m>2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determine whether or not each of the models below is a power model. If it is a power model, identify the quantities, the coefficient, and the power. If it's not a power model, explain why not.
