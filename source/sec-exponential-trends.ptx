    <introduction>
        <p>
            We saw in <xref ref="sec-linear-trends"/> that in the real world, it's more common to have data that is <em>approximately</em> linear than it is to have data that is <em>exactly</em>. The same thing is true of exponential models! Today, we will put the skills we've been learning together to find a formula for an exponential model for a data set with an exponential trend.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Exponential models are more sensitive to small differences in the relative change than linear models are to small differences in the average rate of change. This means that it's harder to get a good estimate for the relative change of approximately exponential data than it is to estimate the average rate of change of approximately linear data. To get around this problem, we'll use logs to turn approximately exponential data into approximately linear data, find a linear model for the log of our data, then use the <q>raise 10 to the power of</q> operation to get an exponential model for our original data.

                                    The population appears to have grown exponentially, from a little under a million people in 1700 to about 343 million in 2023.

                    The trend of the data resembles the graphs of an increasing exponential model. Logs are often used to analyze trends when the data seems to grow exponentially. The graph above right shows the <em>log</em> of the population. The years are kept the same, but the vertical axis shows the log of the population instead of the population itself. A graph that takes the log of the data values on one of the two axes is called a <term>semi-log graph</term>.

                    We can use either graph to estimate the US population in a year. For example, we see from the population data graph that the US population in 1990 was about 250 million. From the log population graph, we see that the log of the population in 1990 was about 8.4. If we let <m>P</m> be the population, we get the log equation <me>\log(P) \approx 8.4</me>. As we learned in <xref ref="sec-exponential-trends-prep"/>, this tells us that <m>P \approx 10^{8.4} = 251,188,643.151</m>, which is about 250 million.
