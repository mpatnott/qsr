    <title>Prep Activities: Average Rates of Change</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            These activities will help you review some graphing skills that you will need in many future lessons. You will also review finding average speed, which you will build on in this lesson.

                There are many types of graphs in math! In previous courses, you may have seen:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bar charts</li>
                    <li>Pie charts</li>
                    <li>Scatterplots</li>
                    <li>Graphs of functions in the <m>xy-</m>plane</li>
                </ul>
                and more. When we talk about graphs in this class, we will always mean graphs of points or curves in the <m>xy-</m>plane (unless we specifically say otherwise). We will use these graphs in almost every lesson, so it is essential that you know how to read and create them.

                   The graph below shows several points  in the <m>xy-</m>plane (aka coordinate plane). The <term>horizontal axis</term> goes from left to right and is the boldest left-to-right line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the <term><m>x-</m>axis</term>. The <term>vertical axis</term> goes up and down and is the boldst up-and-down line if the graph includes more than one such line. In previous classes, you may have called this the <term><m>y-</m>axis</term>. The axes are two number lines that create a grid on the coordinate plane. (Note: Axis is singular and axes is plural.)

                    The point at which the two axes intersect is called the <term>origin</term>. This point represents 0 for both axes, and is given the <term>coordinates</term> (aka <term>ordered pair</term>) <m>(0,0)</m>. Each point in the plane has coordinates (horizontal value, vertical value). For example, the point <m>A</m> has the coordinates <m>(2,3)</m>, the point <m>B</m> has the coordinates <m>(-3,1)</m>, and the point <m>J</m> has coordinates <m>(-4,0)</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Write the coordinates of the rest of the points in this graph.
