                    <li>This works because the operation of <fillin characters="10" /> "undoes" the operation of

    <p>
        Now we would like to introduce a new operation which "undoes"  exponentiation. That operation is written as <m>\log(x)</m>, and we say this as "the log of x."" 
    </p>
    <p>
        The term log is an abbreviation for the mathematical term <term>logarithm</term>. A logarithm is a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a logarithm, or log operation, can be used to find the exponent to which one must raise the number 10 to get the specific number as the output. 
        <ul>
            <li>The expression "<m>\log(1000)</m>" is then equal to <m>3</m>, since <m>10^3=1000</m>.</li>
            <li>The expression "<m>\log(10)</m>" is then equal to <m>1</m>, since <m>10^1=10</m>.</li>
            <li>The expression "<m>\log\left(10^x\right)</m>" is then equal to <m>x</m>, since <m>10^x=10^x</m>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most scientific and graphing calculators have a button or function labeled "Log" which performs this calculation. Calculators will assume that the base is 10 unless you specifically ask them to use a different base. We'll stick with base 10 for now.

        Now we would like to use the log operation to solve equations. Consider the equation <m>10^x=16</m>. Notice that the exponent is not a whole number in this case. We can still solve this equation by doing something to both sides of the equation, as we did in <xref ref="pa-undoing-operations-warmup"/>. In this case, we will "take the log" of both sides of the equation:

    <p>
        We can can check this result using a calculator. If <m>x = 1.204</m>, we get <me> 10^x= 10^{1.204} = 15.996</me>, which is about <m>16</m>. It is not <em>exactly</em> <m>16</m> because we rounded <m>log 16</m> to three decimal places. Logs are often terrible decimals.
