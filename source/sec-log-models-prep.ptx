        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let's consider the steps we'd take to solve several equations!

        <task>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Fill in the blanks:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> In order to solve the equation <m>x+7= -2</m> you could <fillin characters="20" /> from both sides of the equation. </li>
                    <li>This works because the operation of <fillin characters="10" /> "undoes" the operation of 
                        <fillin characters="10" />.</li>
                    <li>After performing this step, you arrive at the solution, <m>x = <fillin characters="10" /></m>.</li>
                </ol>
            </statement>

        <task>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Fill in the blanks:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> In order to solve the equation <m>3x = 15</m> you could <fillin characters="20" /> both sides of the equation by <fillin characters="5" />. </li>
                    <li>This works because the operation of <fillin characters="10" /> "undoes" the operation of 
                        <fillin characters="10" />.</li>
                    <li>After performing this step, you arrive at the solution, <m>x = <fillin characters="10" /></m>.</li>

                <p>
                    Fill in the blanks:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> In order to solve the equation <m>x^2 = 15</m> you could <fillin characters="20" /> both sides of the equation. </li>
                    <li>This works because the operation of <fillin characters="10" /> "undoes" the operation of 
                        <fillin characters="10" />.</li>
                    <li>After performing this step, you arrive at the solution, <m>x = <fillin characters="5" /> \text{ or } <fillin characters="5" /></m>.</li>
