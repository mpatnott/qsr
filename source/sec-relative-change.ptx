                The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who are unemployed and actively seeking work. Going into the Covid pandemic in January 2020, the unemployment rate in the United States was 3.5%. In May of that year, unemployment was 13.2%. There are many ways that this change in unemployment rate could be described. Fill in the blanks in the following statements so they correctly describe this change.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                <term>Inflation</term> is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the buying power of currency is falling. In other words, if everything else (rent, groceries, utilities, etc.) gets more expensive, but your salary stays the same, your buying power decreases.  To account for that, some state and private sector employees get annual salary adjustments, often  referred to as Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA).

            The Consumer Price Index (CPI)<fn><url href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp" /></fn> is often used in the US to measure inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI every month by looking at the prices of a collection of goods and services, including cars and housing. The inflation rate is the relative change in the CPI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The average price of a new car in 1945 was $1,020. The Consumer Price Index was 18.0 in 1945 and 271.0 in 2021. Use this information to answer the following question: $1,020 in 1945 has the same buying power as how many dollars in 2021?

                    When communicating quantitative information, an infographic can be a useful tool. In order to help people understand the national debt adjusted to 2021 dollar amounts, we can draw bags of money to illustrate the change. If we use a 4 cm segment (4 bags of money) to represent the 1945 national debt adjusted for inflation (see figure below), how long should the segments be for each of the other years' national debt after adjusting to 2021 amounts? Round your answers to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.

                    According to the U.S. Treasury Department, a one-hundred-dollar bill is 0.0043 inches thick. Therefore, a stack of 100 one-hundred-dollar bills would be 0.43 inches thick. Assume that we could create stacks of one-hundred-dollar bills that would never topple over, no matter the height. How tall is the stack of money that represents each year's inflation-adjusted national debts?

            <p>
                Now let us consider a different approach to analyzing the U.S. national debt over time. Just as the cost of dinner and a movie for a person before and after college can be compared as a percentage of their income, economists frequently compare the national debt at different times in history by measuring it as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The GDP is the estimated value of all the goods and services that are produced in a country in a given year.

Lucian is starting some long-term planning and wants to decide if he should stay with this company and seek a promotion, or if he wants to explore other options with another company, or even try a new career.

                Lucian has access to the following data from the past seven years about typical salaries for Sales Associates, Sales Supervisors, and Regional Sales Managers. Notice that salaries do not always increase from one year to the next. Lucian wants to get a better idea about how the salaries change over time for each of these positions, to gain insight into his earning potential if he stays with his current company.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                One way to systematically look at a large set of relative changes over time is to create an <term>index</term>. We used the Consumer Price Index earlier to help us understand inflation. Now, you'll compute a salary index to help Lucian's career discernment. A salary index will look like a table of numbers that answer the question, "The salary for this year is what percent of the base year?"

                <p>
                    Use the salary information from the earlier to create a salary index for each of the three positions. You will be creating three separate indices, one for Sales Associate, one for Sales Supervisor, and one for Regional Sales Manager. Use 2016 as the base year, and round each answer to the nearest tenth.

            <p>
                So far, we've learned how to compare quantities using absolute and relative change. Quantities are also commonly compared using <term>ratios</term> and <term>indexes</term> (like the Consumer Price Index!). For example, if Danela's 2022 salary was $81,000 and her 2023 salary was $85,000, here's how we can compare these values using all four methods
