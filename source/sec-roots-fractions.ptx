                The cube root law is a power model, even though it doesn't look like one at first. Use the fact that cube roots are the same as the 1/3rd power to rewrite the cube root law so that it looks like a power model.

    <introduction>
        <p>
            The resting energy expenditure (REE) is the amount of energy a person or animal needs for basic bodily functions. In the 1930s, biologist Max Kleiber<fn>Z. Wang, T. O'Connor, S. Heshka, and s. Heymsfield. ``The Reconstruction of Kleiber's Law at the Organ-Tissue Level.'' <em>The Journal of Nutrition</em> v. 131, no. 11. doi: 10.1093/jn/131.11.2967</fn> discovered that there is a relationship between the REE of an adult mammal and its body mass: <me>R = 70 \times M^{3/4}</me> where <m>R</m> is a mammal's REE (in kcal/d) and <m>M</m> is its body mass (in kg).

                In order to find the body mass of a mammal with REE 1400 kcal/d, we need to undo the 3/4ths power. We don't usually talk about the 3/4ths root. Instead, we stick with fractional exponents. To undo the 3/4ths power, we'll use the 1/(3/4)ths power.  Here's how this example works out!
                <me>1400 = 70 \times M^{3/4}</me>
                Divide both sides by 70 to get:
                <me>20 = M^{3/4}</me>
                Raise both sides to the 1/(3/4)ths power:
                <me>20^{1/(3/4)} = \left(M^{3/4}\right)^{1/(3/4)}</me>
                <me>54.29 = M</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Note:</em> 1/(3/4) is hard to read and work with! It's important to get the parentheses right, since 1/(3/4) and (1/3)/4 are different (try to plug both into a calculator and see for yourself!). Instead of doing 1/(3/4), it's more common to either turn 3/4 into a decimal and do 1/0.75, or to use fraction arithmetic rules to rewrite 1/(3/4) as 4/3.
